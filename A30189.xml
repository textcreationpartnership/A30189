            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Neither ſhall wee preſent thee with the Authors deſerved praiſes, ſeeing his rare pietie and great learning were ſufficiently knowne to very many of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rankes, who were well acquainted with him, and his workes already Printed have given a competent proofe hereof unto all others who have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <pb facs="tcp:59346:3"/>have cauſleſly beene caſt upon him, and by others too much and too eaſily believed againſt him, (a thing inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to men moſt eminent, and innocent, as inſtances in all Ages will evince) not only to the blemiſhing of his juſt eſtimation, but alſo (as we conceive) to the prejudice of the truth it ſelfe, and in favour of many ſpreading er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and exorbitances.</p>
            <p>Thoſe aſperſions which wee ſhall endeavour to take off are two, which though they openly contradict each other, yet they unhappily agree to defame our worthy friend, whoſe credit wee judge our ſelves many wayes bound to vindicate and preſerve.</p>
            <p>The one, intimating ſome degree of declining from his former inconformitie, in deſerting the Nonconformiſts cauſe and grounds, being too much inclined to favour the times in our Ceremonies and Service book.</p>
            <p>The other, expreſſing his advancing beyond the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted limets of a Nonconformiſt towards the cauſe and courſe of ſeparation.</p>
            <p>Two things are pretended to confirme the former. 1. A paſſage in the Preface of his Book called, <hi>A friendly tryall of the grounds tending to ſeparation, &amp;c.</hi> pag. 3. his words are theſe. <hi>Many are the objections which are made againſt ſet formes of Prayer, and particularly against our booke of Common Prayer; All which I have endeavoured to anſwer ſeverally, not becauſe they are of ſo great weight; but becauſe I deſired fully to ſatisfie every doubt, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, that in the whole frame of the ſame booke he ſpeakes more covertly and coldly againſt the corruptions of our Church than became a man who continued ſtedfaſt in the wayes of Nonconformity.</p>
            <p>For Anſwer whereunto, we affirme in the Generall, That upon our knowledge he lived and dyed a ſtrict for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer and firme oppoſer of all ſuch corruptions as the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> (heretofore ſo uſually called) had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly by their publike writings diſallowed. Nor have
<pb facs="tcp:59346:3"/>wee knowne any man in that kinde more preciſe, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and conſtant to his opinion in diſcourſe, prayers, and practices, yet alwayes carried on with Chriſtian mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and meekeneſſe; which graces are of ſingular uſe in controverſies of this nature: yea ſome of us can witneſſe his purpoſe, (if God had lent him longer life) by a ſet Treatiſe to have ſhewed himſelfe a plaintiffe for the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> againſt the corruptions in our Church, as in this hee appeares their defendant againſt the Calumnies of <hi>Maſter Can.</hi> Theſe teſtimonies may ſatisfie the ſober minded, that he continued cordial to their cauſe; whereunto more might be added, but wee deſire not to revive the remembrance of theſe differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong deare brethren: Becauſe wee pray and hope that through Gods mercy; by meanes of our Gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne, and of the preſent Parliament, they will in ſuch ſort be buried, that they ſhall ariſe no more to our diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance and diſcomfort.</p>
            <p>More particularly to the paſſage objected out of the forecited Preface, we Anſwer, That the words themſelvs doe not neceſſarily imply any ſuch ſenſe; but they may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, yea they will carry a better conſtruction, if the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will be candid and well adviſed. For he ſaith not, that he hath anſwered the objections, as ſuggeſting little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing blameworthy in our Liturgie, but becauſe they are not of ſo great weight as to inforce the unlawfulneſſe of thoſe ſet formes, or warrant a ſeparation from our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and publike worſhip in regard thereof. All which both the title of the Booke, and the tenour of the whole diſcourſe therein, together with this Treatiſe exhibited will ſufficiently cleare unto the indifferent and attentive Reader. And that this was his meaning, ſome of us can teſtifie from his owne mouth, which alſo he would have manifeſted to the world (if God had lengthened his life) either in an Epiſtle annexed to this worke, now brought into the open light, or ſome other way, as might have been judged moſt convenient.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59346:4"/>
            <p>But you will ſay. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
               </label> The other ground of this imputation is more pregnant, for why did he not ſpeake out againſt the corruptions of the times as others did? Nay, why did he ſeek to clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the book of Common Prayer of ſome things charged upon it?</p>
            <p>Two things we conceive may fully take off the ſtrength of this objection. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> 1. Becauſe it was impertinent here to aggravate or multiply corruptions objected, but rather to ſhew, that as in ſome things the booke by them was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercharged, ſo notwithſtanding all that could be alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt it, yet ſeparation from our worſhip could not be lawfull, much leſſe neceſſarie.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſtate of thoſe times wherein this piece was pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned would not brooke more plainneſſe in that and ſuch like points; this we could (if it were expedient) aboundantly evidence, by declaring with what difficultie it paſſed the Preſſe, what exceptions were taken at ſome harmeleſſe expreſſions, and what amendments were exacted in ſome phraſes, which ſeemed ſomewhat openly to hint the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors heart-workings towards that Reformation which in theſe times is much deſired and endeavoured.</p>
            <p>The ſecond imputation remaines to be removed <hi>(viz.)</hi> that though our Reverend Author had both reaſoned and written againſt the opinions and practice of ſeparation in the time of his health, yet on his death bed he did retract, and with griefe repent what in that kinde he had done.</p>
            <p>This is commonly reported, confidently believed, and gladly embraced, not only here at home, but alſo in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne parts, even in <hi>America,</hi> as by divers letters and other wayes ſome of us have beene informed.</p>
            <p>It is high time therefore to give open check unto theſe groundles rumours, leſt the cauſe here maintained ſhould thereby ſuffer prejudice, either in the mindes of them who are friends, or of thoſe who be adverſaries thereunto. And for this end we intreat the Reader firſt to conſider that this imputation being directly contrary to the former, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:59346:4"/>they muſt confute each other, or elſe argue the man ſtrangely light in wheeling from one extreame unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or guilty of a fowler fault, in writing one thing and thinking another: from both which charges we aſſure our ſelves his great ſoliditie in judgement, and pietie in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice will fully abſolve him in the conſciences of all ſuch who were acquainted with him.</p>
            <p>And as for others, we hope they may bee aboundantly ſatisfied by the enſuing evidence.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in that foure or five dayes before his death he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to ſome of us his willingneſſe to have this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe preſented to publike view, which hee had compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſince the former.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſo ſoone as he had finiſhed this book, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke a large Treatiſe of the Church, wherein he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to diſcover the nature of Schiſme, and to deale in the main controverſies touching the eſſence and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the viſible Church.</p>
            <p>Concerning theſe matters, we have almoſt fifty ſheets of Paper written with his owne hand, wherein many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages expreſle his continued diſlike of the ſeparations, both then and now in practice. And theſe writings, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his other papers, he on his death bed commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the care of ſome of us, to be diſpoſed of for private or publike uſe, as we ſhould judge expedient.</p>
            <p>Had there beene any griefe upon his Spirit, or alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his judgement, in reference to what he had ſpoken or printed againſt the ſeparation, we know none ſo likely to have beene acquainted therewith as our ſelves. For one of us dwelling neare unto him, was for many years his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome companion, and in his laſt ſickneſſe ſeldome from him. Another (being requeſted during, his weakneſſe, to ſupply his place) ſo journing in the ſame towne, was daily with him.</p>
            <p>The other three of us (being his familiar friends) did all viſit him, within one, two or three dayes before his
<pb facs="tcp:59346:5"/>end. We are all of us, as we hope (though moſt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy) the Miniſters of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> who deſire to be faithful. And we doe each for our ſelves ſeriouſly proteſt in the preſence of Almighty God, that we never heard any ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable from him ſounding that way.</p>
            <p>Yea, there is one thing more to be added, which may for ever ſilence all gaineſayers <hi>(viz.)</hi> That one of us through Gods good providence, ſuſpecting what hath ſince fallen out, and being deſirous to prevent ſuch falſe rumours, within leſſe than two dayes before his death, and not many houres before he was ſpeechleſſe, asked him to this effect, Whether he had any remorſe or diſquiet in his minde for any thing hee had written in oppoſition to the way of Separation, whereto he thus anſwered, <hi>I thanke God I have not any, but I rather take comfort in what I have done, and could have deſired (if it had beene the will of God) to have lived a while longer to have given further aſsiſtance in that worke.</hi> And this queſtion was propounded to him, and the Anſwer returned by him, not only in the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſome other of us, but alſo of ſundry other godly friends, who can atteſt the truth of this relation.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, We boldly challenge any perſon to come forth, and to make proofe either by word, or writing, that this our Reverend Brother either repented his paines, or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his judgement againſt the way of ſeparation; which if he ſhall accordingly doe, then will we be content to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the ſevereſt cenſures, that are due unto unjuſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors of the truth. But if any failing herein, ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after perſiſt to promote either by ſcattering or crediting the forenamed reports, wee leave them to the judgement of all indifferent men, whether they deſerve not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted defamers of the dead, and lyars againſt the truth, if not ſubtile promoters of their owne cauſe and courſe, by pretending falſly the Patronage of their Adverſary, when they could not ſtand before his Arguments.</p>
            <p>But in probabilitie ſome will thus reply to our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,
<pb facs="tcp:59346:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>That if your friend did not retract, the more was his ſin, and the leſſe his honour. Unto whom we returne this anſwer, That this cenſure ſtrongly preſumes his former diſcourſe in the maine matter to be erroneous and unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, whereas that is the thing ſtill in queſtion, and (as we verily believe) cannot be ſolidly proved. And though our Reverend Brother be dead, (whom God had extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily fitted for diſputes of this nature) yet we doubt not but the living Lord wil raiſe up for himſelf ſome other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to maintain the truth which he had undertaken.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more (Chriſtian Reader) which we deſire thee to take notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> That whereas it is often reported, that this Authors former booke was fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, before it paſſed the Preſſe, and that therefore fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwer there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o cannot bee expected, wee ſhall relate the truth for thy ſatisfaction in that particular.</p>
            <p>Our worthy Brother, having by Conference (as ſome of us, and others know) with unſhaken ſtrength defended the lawfulnes of ſet formes of Prayer, he was afterwards by a Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ter, ſent from a worthy Gentleman, M. <hi>Richard Knightly,</hi> requeſted to ſtate that queſtion, then much in agitation, and to give in ſome arguments for his perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſetling. Hereupon in the ſpace of one day (the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger ſtaying for an anſwer to the letter) he did ſet down his judgment, with ſome grounds thereof, and ſent them unto his much honoured friend: from whom a copie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing procured and conveyed into New <hi>England,</hi> it ſeems an Anſwer was undertaken by a reverend brother there. In the meane time, the number of them increaſing who withdrew themſelves from our Church Aſſemblies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Liturgie there uſed, he was importuned both by Miniſters and others from divers parts of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to take ſome further paines in that Controverſie. This occaſioned the peruſall of his former papers, and the examining of thoſe Arguments which he met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, either in Printed bookes, Manuſcrip s, or the Rela i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:59346:6"/>on of friends, againſt the uſe of ſet forms of prayer in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and of our Common prayer booke particularly. And thus the Embrio biggened, and being ready to be brought forth into the light, an anſwer unto the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions came to the Authors hand, wherein was nothing materiall (as he conceived) but what was anſwered in the book<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, then about to be licenced: yet by reaſon of ſome exceptions in another frame ſuggeſted, he judged it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to annex a few marginall notes unto his booke, as thou mayeſt obſerve, page 13.15.24.33. &amp;c. being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing in a more open way to reply upon the private an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of him, whom he highly prized, and intending (if God had ſpared life) to have returned more large and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular animadverſions to himſelfe in private.</p>
            <p>The Almighty ſpeedily caſt out of his Church all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of offence, cleare up doubtfull truths unto the hearts of his people, Compound all differences amongſt Brethren, make us all of one minde, heart, and way in his worſhip, that our diviſions may no longer diſhonour the Goſpell, diſtract the weak conſcience, diſinable us to do that good we deſire, or put weapons into the hands of then, who oppoſe that reformation, the perfecting whereof our ſoules long for, through JESUS CHRIST.</p>

                     <p>In the Propoſition, as it is ſet down, that we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſenſe thereof, two things are to be conſidered.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59346:14"/>1. What is meant by a falſe Miniſterie. 2. What it is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in a falſe Miniſterie.</p>
                     <p>In plaine and diſtinct dealing, a falſe Miniſtery is not to be confounded with a maymed, defective, or impure Miniſtery, for as the Goſpel may be preached truly when it is taught impurely, ſo may the Miniſtery be true for ſubſtance, when it is impure in ſome reſpects. But ſeeing in your language, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unlearned, ſcandalous, negligent Miniſter, is a falſe Miniſter, and the Miniſterie which he executeth, is a falſe Miniſtery; therefore to omit further conteſtation about the word, It muſt be noted, That a falſe Miniſtery is twofold. 1. Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as is no wayes appointed of God, in reſpect of the ſubſtance of the office, whereunto he is ſet apart, as if a Miniſter be called to preach pernicious and damnable doctrine, or to offer Sacrifice propitiatory for quick and dead, and this Miniſtery is a meere nullitie. 2 Comparative, or in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as that which is maymed in the qualities, or care of the party choſen; or deſigned, as if a man unlearned, ſcandalous, idle be choſen; if he feed not the flock, or teach without po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and authoritie. And this Miniſtery is defective, but of force and efficacy to the people of God: for ſubſtance, it is of God, for the good of his flock, and what is done in the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is done by the authoritie of God, but the perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if in no meaſure qualified, are not allowed and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of God.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond phraſe, To communicate in the falſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, may import two things. Firſt, to communicate in the ſinnes of the Miniſtery,

If God ſet Tyrants over a people in wrath, may not the Righteous ſeek protection under them, or receive right by their government. God takes no pleaſure in an ungodly Miniſter, but he is pleaſed to place them here and there, that the children of bleſſing might receive by their Miniſterie, what the Lord hath promiſed, and knoweth to be expedient for them. The Church-acts of ungodly Miniſters, are to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unprofitable, and in them ſinfull, abominable, but to the Congregation, they may be profitable, effectuall, acceptable, as they are done for them, not without ſome calling, by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and authoritie from God.</p>

And even from this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mination it will follow, That if Miniſters who deſpiſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and underſtanding, be permitted, by ſuch as have power to caſt them out, but doe not; they retaine their power and authoritie ſtill, for the good of the faithfull, untill God be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to caſt them off, and turne them out of office, though their function be not pleaſing unto God.</p>

                     <p>The Faithfull entreate Chriſt, <hi>To ſhew them where he feedeth his flock;</hi> that they might <hi>not turne aſide</hi> (if the words will beare that interpretation) <hi>to the flocks of his companions,</hi> that is, the Congregations of falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets.

If your meaning be, that Chriſt by theſe means doth feed or rule his Flock, it will eaſily be granted. If it be this, That no Chriſtian may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſit downe in any congregation, where any one of theſe is wanting, or not executed in all points as it ought; you ſpeak of your ſelfe, and not by the warrant of Gods Word.

Falſe Teachers, who did barke againſt the doctrine of ſalvation by Chriſt, preſſed Circumciſion, as neceſſarie to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were returned to their old vomite, and being formerly of Jews made Chriſtians, were fallen back to Judaiſme. And is there any Queſtion, but we muſt take heed of theſe, and all others of the ſame kinde? And this is that which <hi>Zanchy</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, by many other Texts of Scripture, <hi>Viz. That not onely the Teachers, but the Faithfull must learne to know and beware of ravening wolves, blinde guides, who bring not the doctrine of Christ, denie all the Articles of Faith, or ſome at leaſt ſpeake per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe things, and draw Diſciples after them.</hi> But what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of ſhame and honeſtie, when men apply this againſt them that preach Chriſt truely and intirely, and adminiſter the holy things of God purely, by authority received from God? Or againſt communicating with them in the Ordinances of God, who profeſſe the faith, are called to diſpence the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Religion, becauſe in ſome particular, their calling was not orderly, as it ought, or the perſons endued with gifts,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59346:19"/>as God requireth. Further anſwere may be taken out of that which hath been ſpoken, to the former paſſages, for one anſwer will fit them all.</p>
                     <p>To communicate in the true Worſhip of God, with Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters no better than ignorant, idle, proud, cruell, covetous and profane Prieſts, no better than Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>is neither a vaine worſhip, nor an abetting of the party in his ſinne, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell againſt the Lord, nor to commit spirituall whoredome, or to embrace the boſome of an harlot.</hi> Theſe are great words to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright, but they are of no force to hurt, if a man will not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly yeeld without any combate. No, to communicate with ſuch, when God called us thereunto, is to worſhip God aright, to reverence his ordinances, to rely on his grace, to hearken unto his voice, and ſubmit unto his good pleaſure. To ſuch communicating he hath promiſed and vouchſafed his bleſſing, their ſervice is acceptable unto God, becauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by him, and they have found him graciouſly preſent to cheere and refreſh them. It is without queſtion, the Prophets, our Saviour, the Apoſtles, the Faithfull in all ages have communicated with ſuch in Gods Ordinances, but not in their ſinne: And what man well adviſed will ſay of that practice, that it was either Rebellion againſt God, or ſpirituall whoredom, or vaine worſhip?

                     <p>The Nonconformiſts complain of many groſſe abuſes in the Miniſterie, in the Election, Ordination, Qualities of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon admitted, and execution of the function; as, that ignorant, negligent, profane men are ſet over the flock; and Non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, Pluraliſts, men of corrupt mindes, who diſcourage the godly, and hearten the profane. But this complaint they put not up againſt all, but many in the Miniſtery. The Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence you would make upon their ground is, That it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to communicate, not onely with theſe men, in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Gods Worſhip, but even with the moſt learned, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and painfull, who teach the Truth, live holily, diſpence the Myſteries of Godlineſſe purely, be approved of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and bleſſed of the moſt high.</p>

But it is no new thing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them as the Authors of errors, hereſies, or ſchiſmes, who principally laboured the ſuppreſſing of them. No man cryed downe the Errour of the Manichees concerning a good God and an evill, ſo much as <hi>Auſtine:</hi> and yet their opinion is charged upon them that hold his opinion of abſolute Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The poſitions of the Stoicks anſwere to the opinions
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59346:22"/>of the Remonſtrants concerning Free Will and power in Man: but the contrary ſide is burdened therewith. The grounds of the Nonconformiſts ſtand directly oppoſite to the ſpeciall grounds of Separation, and yet they heare from ſome, that they be Separatiſts in heart, from others, that they have laid the foundation, and the Separatiſts build upon it, and that ſuch as have made anſwere to the Separatiſts, doe againſt conſcience put out the light, which hath been by themſelves chiefly revealed.</p>
                     <p>It is true, they complaine of abuſes in the Church (and not to excuſe humane frailty) ſometimes with heat and fervour exceſſive, and humbly ſue for reformation. But to ſeek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe of what is out of order, is rather to endeavour the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire of what is ruinous, than the plucking of it down. <hi>Jt is one thing dutifully to urge the proceeding of our Church unto perfection, another, ſchiſmatically to leave, and forſake her.

                     <p>Thirdly, The Miniſter doth not derive his power or authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, either vertually or formally from the people, but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from Chriſt, whoſe ſervant he is, for the Churches uſe and benefit, in whoſe name he muſt execute his office, whoſe meſſage he muſt deliver, whoſe ſeales he muſt diſpence, and to whom he muſt give account.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59346:25"/>or that libertie be taken from them, they conceive it to be a maime or defect in the calling of the Miniſter; but this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect doth not make a nullitie of the office, or acts done by vertue of that calling, which he hath: For in every true Church, where the Word of God is intirely Preached, and received, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments for ſubſtance rightly adminiſtred, there is a true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, and a true calling to the Miniſterie, though in ſome things maimed and faultie. In the Church of God, and no where elſe, all ſound and ſaving truth is to be found: for the Church is the pillar and ground of Truth; and where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of all ſaving Truth, with the right adminiſtration of the Sacraments is found, there is the Church, which ordinarily can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had, maintained or continued, without a true Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, nor that without a true calling.</p>

But if the people be few, ſimple, apt to be deceived, unable to judge of the fitneſſe of a Miniſter, they ſtand in need of direction, not onely from their owne Elders, but from other Churches. The practice of the Apoſtles will confirme this: for ſometimes men were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto the Church to be choſen, and ſometimes the choice was wholly left unto them. And was not this for our direction, that more libertie may be given, where the danger is leſſe, and more caution and reſtraint uſed, where the danger is apparant, that if they be left unto themſelves, either an ill, or an unfit choice ſhall be made? In reaſon it is evident, for the childs conſent is required in marriage, and the more able he is to chuſe for himſelfe, the more liberty may Parents grant him in his choice, but if he be not able, or leſſe able, the more watchfull muſt they be over him; and ſo in this matter.</p>

                     <p>THe ſinewes of this Argument are cut already in the firſt Section, if ever it had any, and therefore a few words may now ſuffice. In this reaſon you take for granted, that which is moſt falſe, little leſſe than blaſphemie; to wit, that all Miniſters in the Church of England be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian. For they are in reſpect of the ſubſtance of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, ſet apart to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, diſpenſe the Sacraments, and adminiſter the Diſcipline of the Lord Chriſt: and many of them the approved ſervants of Chriſt, furniſhed with gifts from above, ſent forth by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to preach the Goſpel of God, and diſpenſe his Sacraments, which they faithfully execute, according to commiſſion recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from their Lord and Maſter, the King of the Church, who worketh by them, and bleſſeth their labours, if ever ordinary Miniſters had cauſe to ſpeake of, and rejoyce in the bleſſing of God, to the praiſe of his name.</p>
                     <p>But to let that paſſe, Antichriſtian Teachers (if I muſt ſpeak in your owne language) be of divers ſorts:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Such as be not called in every point according to your platforme, or at leaſt whoſe calling is in any reſpect maymed or defective, though they be godly, learned, painfull, every way fit, ſet apart by authority, and approved by the Church. If An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Teachers be taken in this ſenſe, true Beleevers living in ſocieties with them are bound to heare the Word, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the Sacraments, becauſe they be the ordinances of the Lord Jeſus, who is preſent, knocking at the doore of the heart, and will come in and ſup with them that open unto him.

                        </note> Look what reaſons ſoever can be alledged to prove that Chriſtians ought to joyne together in holy communion, the ſame will ſtrongly convince, that ordinarily, or occaſionally we muſt hold ſocietie with ſuch Miniſters in the ordinances of piety and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. And if this Miniſterie be Antichriſtian, divers, if not moſt worthy Martyrs of Jeſus Chriſt, that have withſtood An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt unto blood, have ſtood under ſome ordinances, in their firſt originall, Antichriſtian, or of men in ſome reſpects, which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59346:33"/>did not overthrow, though it might be ſome blemiſh unto their Miniſterie.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such as be not rightly called by men, becauſe not rightly furniſhed with gifts, or faithfully executing their place, or teaching erroneous doctrines and traditions of men, but yet ſet apart to an office which is of God, and in communion of men profeſſing the true Faith, are called Antichriſtian Miniſters. And if it be taken in this ſenſe, the faithfull are bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to heare ſuch, if they live in their ſocieties: becauſe they be the Miniſters of Chriſt in a ſort, though they be not approved of him, and doe his worke for the good of them that be heires of ſalvation. But in ſo doing, they doe not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the Miniſters of Antichriſts apoſtaſie, but with the Lord Chriſt in his holy ordinance, by ſuch meanes as he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.

                        <hi>Hierome</hi> noteth, that there are foure ſorts, who are employed in the buſineſſes and affaires of Almighty God. The firſt, ſuch as are ſent neither of men, nor by men, but by Jeſus Chriſt. The ſecond, ſuch as are ſent of God, but by man. The third are ſuch as are ſent of man and not of God, who are they that are ordained by favour of Men, not rightly judging of the quality of them who are to ſerve in this calling. Who yet are not ſimply denyed to be ſent of God, as if they had not commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from him, but therefore only, becauſe if the chooſers and ordainers had done their duties, they ſhould have made a better choice. For being ſent by men that have authoritie, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing the ſame, wee cannot ſay they have no true or lawfull Miniſtery: for then were all miniſtration of the Sacraments, and other ſacred things void, performed by ſcandalous, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Miniſters, and ſuch as by ſiniſter meanes get into theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly places. The fourth are of ſuch as are neither ſent of God, nor of men, nor by men, but runne of themſelves, and have no calling at all: who are neither Miniſters of Chriſt for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor others.

                     <p n="3">3 Such are Antichriſtian Miniſters, as teach falſe doctrine, be ſet apart to an office meerely of men, contrary to the Word of God, and live in communion and ſocietie with men profeſſing reall idolatrie, as members of that ſocietie, though ſomewhat of God be joyned in this their profeſſion.

                        </note> in this third and fourth acceptation, I grant the faithfull muſt hold no communion with them, becauſe God hath forbidden it, and theſe are falſe Prophets, who have no calling, teach their owne dreames, miniſter not the things of God, but of men, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther never were members of the true Church, profeſſing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire faith, or upon their diſcoverie, are caſt forth as unſavorie ſalt. And this the paſſages of Scripture, quoted to prove the controverſall part, as you ſay, doe confirme, Whereunto anſwere hath been given already. And the authours of all ſorts alledged, doe conſent: for it is moſt manifeſt, they ſpeake of falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who have no calling, teach falſe doctrine, were never members of the Church, or ſpringing up, and continuing in the Church for a time, are cenſured and caſt out, that they might not moleſt, tare and devoure the Flock.

                     <p>And here conſider how plentifull you are in proving that which was never queſtioned; as that the Scripture is perfect, to make the man of God wiſe unto ſalvation, that falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets muſt not be heard or beleeved, that the Faithfull muſt come out of <hi>Babylon, &amp;c.</hi> But that the Miniſterie of the Church of England is Antichriſtian, and the Teachers falſe Prophets, as the Scripture uſeth the word in the Texts alledged, this we muſt take upon your bare word, or moſt grievous miſapplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the holy Text.</p>

                        <p>If the meaning of your propoſition bee, That no poſitive worſhip, or ſubſtantiall means of worſhip is lawfull, but what is in ſpeciall appointed, or inſtituted of God, and that no du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion be neceſſary to ſalvation, but what are taught in Scripture, then we grant it is true, and confirmed by the courſe of Scripture, though many paſſages cited by you, will not reach unto it. For the law of nature commandeth all men, who have any ſenſe of a Godhead, to receive, and not give rules of Religion and Worſhip. The holy care of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs was to reverence and obey that which they had received, and to attend upon further direction, but of themſelves not to appoint or undertake any thing as neceſſary to ſalvation. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution of legall and Evangelicall obedience, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is equally full and complete in all things neceſſary, which

But when God had choſen out, and appropriated one place for Sacrifice, and none other, then it was a matter of neceſſitie, holineſſe, and worſhip, to ſacrifice there, and a great ſinne to doe it any where elſe.</p>
                        <p>The reaſon hereof, was not ſimply becauſe it was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, for when it was lawfull to the Fathers of Old, it was not commanded, but left undetermined only, and uſed by them as a circumſtance or adjunct allowed, not as a matter of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, holineſſe or worſhip; not could they have uſed it ſo without ſuperſtition; as on the other ſide, after the ſtrict com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement given to Iſrael, to ſacrifice in the place which God had choſen, and none other, and the place of worſhip pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely determined for typicall ſignification, it was a part of true worſhip, in conſcience neceſſarie: for them to doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, was grievouſly to tranſgreſſe, and not to doe that which was commanded as neceſſary, holy; and worſhip, had been prophaneneſſe. For that which is commanded, may not be neglected, neither is any thing to be done, which is repugnant thereunto.</p>
                        <p>But many things in the worſhip of God are not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or determined by God, but left to the libertie of Chriſtians; many things were unprofitable, and needleſſe to be determined particularly by divine authoritie, as being eaſily diſcernable by the light of nature, and common reaſon: and many things could not be determined, becauſe one order in them could not fit all ages, times and places in the world. The diviſions of the Chapters and verſes, as they are in our Bibles, and the Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Law, as among the Jewes, are of men: and ſo is the phraſe of ſpeech and method uſed in Prayer, Preaching, Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Sacraments, and the very words of Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherein the Scriptures are read, and cannot be one and the ſame in all ſocieties. And ſo are the circumſtances, how oft,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59346:36"/>at what houre, on what day, in what place, the Paſtor ſhall preach, which are particular determinations of the Church, and variable. If you ſay, theſe things are preſcribed in generall and by conſequence, becauſe they are done according to the rules of direction given in Scripture: Of neceſſitie you muſt confeſſe the propoſition is ambiguous: for ſometimes preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, ſhall import, as much as determined, inſtituted, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſanctifyed; if not appropriated: and ſometimes it ſhall note no more, but left at libertie, or indetermined.

                        <p>If the way or manner of Worſhip, be put for immediate Worſhip, then it extends as large as the Commandements of the firſt Table, and the ſenſe of the propoſition muſt be, That no Worſhip, publike or private, muſt be performed to God for ſubſtance, manner or time, other than that which God hath preſcribed in his Word: which holdeth not true, unleſſe it be added, That no worſhip muſt be performed as neceſſary and holy for ſubſtance, manner and time, which God hath not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. For what ſhall we ſay of the time of rivate Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the familie or cloſet, the forme of catechizing, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations of the Scripture, the times for publike Lectures, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Religion upon the week day, and ordering and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Schooles, and Univerſities? for theſe things are not for time, words and manner preſcribed, or determined of God.</p>
                        <p>If the word, Worſhip, be taken more ſtrictly for ſubſtantiall Worſhip, commanded in, or referred to the firſt and ſecond Commandements, uſually known by the titles of inward and outward worſhip, Naturall and poſitive inſtituted Worſhip (though perhaps the termes be not ſo fit, if better were found out) then the meaning is, that no Worſhip of God, inward or outward, naturall or poſitive, is lawfull; but what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and determined of God in his Word. But then there want not difficulties: for how ſhould Worſhip be naturall, if it muſt be inſtituted and preſcribed? If the light of nature or reaſon teach it, which is planted in the heart, by the ſinger of God, how can it be unlawfull, unleſſe it be preſcribed by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59346:37"/>word of inſtitution? What ſhall wee ſay of outward geſtures, made in and upon the body, to declare the hidden af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the ſoule; muſt theſe be preſcribed, and determined, or fall under this cenſure? When the Word informeth me to call upon God in the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt: doth not reaſon it ſelfe without any further inſtitution, teach me to kneele, lift up my hands, &amp;c. At leaſt, if worſhip be naturall, or poſitive, muſt there be a diſtinction of the inſtitution or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of this worſhip alſo? Doth not poſitive Worſhip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire one manner of inſtitution; naturall another?</p>
                        <p>If the way or manner of Worſhip be reſtrained to poſitive, or inſtituted only, it is moſt true; No worſhip is lawfull, which is not in ſpeciall commanded, or appointed of God in his Word. But then the Texts of Scripture, quoted by you for proofe, will not ſpeak unto it.</p>

The concluſion from this Text is, That God is pleaſed to diſpence with his people in his owne preſcribed Worſhip, untill, if he hath appointed, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, or appropriated a certaine forme, time and place, they have opportunitie to ſerve him at that time, in that place, and after that forme.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59346:38"/>or appropriated a certaine forme of place, or that no other Worſhip may be tendred, but what he hath in particular appointed, or preſcribed. This I ſay, cannot be concluded from the Text, though I grant it is a truth rightly underſtood, as I ſaid before.</p>

                        <p>The concluſions from this Text of Scripture, may be ſuch as theſe; That oftentimes the letter of the Law giveth place to great neceſſities; or that Gods worſhip, where he hath preſcribed and determined the manner, muſt be performed as he hath appointed.

How truely you underſtand, or fitly apply that Maxime, it is needleſſe to examine further: but what you obſerve in your Piſtoler (as you ſtile him) that is moſt true in your ſelfe and ſome others, that ignorance or neglect of diſtinguiſhing things that differ in this matter of Gods Worſhip, is one maine cauſe of great error and going aſtray.</p>
                        <p>In proofe of your propoſition alſo, you laviſh ſomewhat, when you ſay without limitation, That all ſorts and ſects of Writers acknowledge it for a truth; For the Papiſts generally hold the contrary, as you know. But this is a thing with you very uſuall and common.</p>
                        <p>The later part of your reaſon, which you ſmoothly paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as a matter cleere, and manifeſt, and for proofe whereof, you ſend us to our conſciences, in conſcience we utterly denie, and by the Word of God are aſſured of the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That to joyne with our congregations in the ordinances of Grace, is a Worſhip of God preſcribed in his Word, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended of Chriſt, and bleſſed of him to them that in conſcience obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. The Worſhip there performed, is that which the Lord hath inſtituted, the doctrine of ſalvation is taught in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, the Sacraments rightly adminiſtred, the ſacrifice of Prayer offered unto God in the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, our onely high Prieſt, who is preſent in the Congregations, by the preſence of his grace, graciouſly inviteth men to come unto him, and ſweetly refreſheth them that in truth of heart draw nigh unto him. Thus God is worſhiped in our aſſemblies, and this worſhip is performed by ſuch as are called of God, and many approved of God in their Office and Miniſterie.</p>
                        <p>That the Preaching and hearing of the Word is a Worſhip of God, if the word, Worſhip, be taken largely to comprehend both all naturall worſhip, and all means inſtituted and ordained, whereby God is pleaſed to teach and inſtruct his people, will eaſily be granted, and ſuch as denie it, are juſtly to be taxed. But that diſtinction of Worſhip muſt be admitted, which is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59346:39"/>taught in Scripture, and the more exactly tearmes are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, the more cleerely the fraud of the Adverſary is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and the better able ſhall we be to confute them, unleſſe we had rather doe it with bigge words than weight of reaſon.</p>

And here you may ſee how the firſt part of the ſentence doth croſſe the later: For if godly Anceſtors did truly worſhip God in the high places, when they were not commanded, then the Iſraelites did not finne grievouſly in carrying their oblations thither, becauſe it was not commanded. What moved you ſo to write, and to alledge Authors, as if they affirmed the ſame, I leave it to your conſcience to judge. This is ſure, neither Scripture nor Author cited, doth ſpeake with you in that matter, but plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſe, that it was unlawfull, becauſe it was expreſly forbidden. That exerciſe (ſaith <hi>Zanchie</hi>) did ſeeme praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to the Iſraelites, and yet it is to play the harlot: Why? becauſe it is ſacriledge to depart from the Word of the Lord.

                        <p>The Kings who are commended in Scripture, who yet tooke not away the high places, as <hi>Aſa, Jehoſaphat, Amaſias, Azarias,</hi> and <hi>Jothian,</hi> they were not commended for ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the high places, but that they were conſtant in faith and religion, although they fell into ſome peculiar ſins. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the abuſe of the high places in the worſhip of God, was no light ſin, but very grievous, becauſe it was properly and expreſly againſt the divine law and precept.</p>

                        <p>Thus all the Jewes and Gentiles are ſaid to ſacrifice unto Divels, who ſacrificed in ſuch ſort and place as God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, eſpecially it they ſacrificed unto Idols, though in them they ſacrificed unto the true God in their imagination, as the Iſraelites had done when they made the golden Calſe, and ſacrificed unto it: and <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Idols are called Divels, and he is ſaid to make Prieſts for the high places and for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels. Further this Ordinance of God was typicall, and did ſhadow forth Chriſt, as the learned do obſerve, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ground and warrant. All Altars, Sacrifices, Prieſts, and the Temple it ſelfe where the Altar ſtood, were but types and ſhadowes of Chriſt. You your ſelfe cite out of Biſhop <hi>Babington,</hi> that hereby was ſignified, that only in the Church by faith in the chiefe high Prieſt Chriſt Jeſus, ſacrifice and ſervice accepted of God, is, and can be offered and done, and no where els.

                        <p>From hence briefly let theſe things be obſerved. 1 That the Jewes ſinned by facrificing in the high places, and the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> becauſe God had forbidden it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, but againſt communicating in our aſſemblies, no ſuch prohibition can be brought forth, which haply might bee the reaſon, why you had rather ſay, becauſe they had no divine precept for it, than becauſe it was forbidden, which yet you know to bee moſt certaine. 2 Though it bee not lawfull to communicate with the people of God in their ſins, yet wee may partake in the ordinances of worſhip, with ſuch as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend grievouſly in the worſhip of God, as the Prophets and faithfull, communicated in the ordinances of God at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> with them that ſacrificed upon the high places. 3. That in Idolatrous and falſe Churches, that which is meerely of men is vaine and fruitleſſe, and a meere nullitie, but if among them, ſomething which is of God remaine, it is not to bee eſteemed a thing of nought. 4 Wee muſt neither forſake all ſocieties, wherein wee eſpie many things repugnant to the

                        <p>Principally, of old the Temple ſhaddowed Chriſt, in and through whom we muſt preſent our ſervice unto <hi>God,</hi> and then the Church of Chriſtians: but that the externall conſtitution of a Congregationall ſocietie is repreſented thereby, in ſuch ſort as if it be thus, or thus conſtituted it ſhould be lawfull to joyne with them, but if this or that externall rite be lacking, it ſhould be unlawfull to joyne in the worſhip of God, is moſt unprobable.

If it be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that oppoſites are relatives, and relatives are together in nature, the anſwer is, they are relatives <hi>ſecundum dici,</hi> as they ſpeake, not <hi>ſecundum eſſe,</hi> which may bee ſaid to be together in nature; Not that both are in act exiſtent out of their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but becauſe the nature of one being knowne the nature of the other may be knowne, whether it be, or be not, whether it may bee or may not bee. Wee know likewiſe, that not only good is oppoſed to evill, but evill to evill, as covetouſneſſe to prodigality and this the Philoſopher himſelfe confeſſeth. So that theſe propoſitions muſt be rightly limited or they are both falſe.

                        <p>By ſpirituall <hi>Babylon</hi> in this booke of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> is meant <hi>Rome</hi> Chriſtian; departed from the faith, guilty of the blood of Saints, ſtained with manyfold and fearfull Idolatries, the mother of fornications, who hath made drunke the Kings of the earth with the cup of her poyſons, as might bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Scripture it ſelf, the joynt conſent of learned or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Divines, and the teſtimonie of Papiſts themſelves.</p>
                        <p>But to brand the Churches of Chriſt ſince the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who have renounced Antichriſts doctrine, worſhip, and idolatries, and embraced the intire faith of the Lord Jeſus, with that odious hatefull name, is contrary to the truth of God, evident reaſon, and the judgement of all approved god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned men.</p>
                        <p>You miſerably corrupt and pervert the Text, when you give this to be the ſenſe thereof, <hi>Remove your ſelves from all falſe Aſſemblies, covenant together to walke in all the wayes of God, ſerve the Lord among your ſelves in ſpirit and truth, and returne not from whence you are come.</hi> This is not to interpret Scripture, and learne of them what wee are to thinke, but to racke Scriptures to our ſenſe, and make them ſpeake ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our fanſies, which is an high point of Antichriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme.</p>
                        <p>If you will ſtand to your principles, within two hundred yeares after Chriſt, or leſſe, there was not one true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſocietie in the whole world, which did walke together in all the wayes of God, and ſerve God in a Church ſtate among themſelves. And will you ſay, the faithfull are charged of God, in this paſſage of holy writ, to remove and ſeparate from all Chriſtian aſſemblies, that then were in the world, and to ſerve God among themſelves. If corruption in doctrine, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, worſhip, government, and orders, make a falſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, <hi>Rome</hi> was a falſe aſſembly long before the Lord gave commandement to his people to depart thence and ſeparate themſelves.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Iſrael</hi> for a time continued in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon, viz.</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Lord ſent to bring them forth: and the Church lay
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59346:47"/>hid in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that by the providence and approbation of God, long after <hi>Rome</hi> was miſerably corrupted and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The matter is notorious, and therefore to ſpend more words about it is needleſſe. Hee that conſidereth the ſtate of things, long before the faithfull ſeparated from <hi>Rome,</hi> and what is written in defence of that ſeparation, which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches have made, cannot be ignorant thereof. If to come out of <hi>Babylon</hi> then, had beene to remove from all falſe aſſemblies, as you gloſſe it, it was neceſſarie the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement had beene given much ſooner, or the faithfull ſhould have departed without leave or commandement from God.</p>
                        <p>I might ſay to you in your owne words,
<note place="margin">CAN Stay. §. 15 pag. 135</note> This is to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the errour of <hi>Montanus,</hi> who profeſſed that he knew more than the Apoſtles. For the Apoſtles knew nothing of our removing from all falſe aſſemblies (as you underſtand it) and covenauting together to walke in all Gods wayes, and ſerve God among themſelves. If this had beene knowne to <hi>John,</hi> when hee foretold the Apoſtaſie from the faith, and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the great Whore, he would have made more haſte to warne the faithfull to bee gone out of the Churches, and to have withdrawn themſelvs, it being a matter of ſuch weight and importance, and ſo needfull to be done, divers hundred years, before it was ever once thought upon, When the words of a Text are plaine, a gree with the circumſtances of the place, the analogie of faith, and other Scriptures, for men then to leave the native ſenſe, and to force a ſenſe contrary to that the letter expreſſeth, it is to wreſt the Scriptures, as you ſay, and not to expound them by the true rules and Canons of Divinitie.

If ſo, then there was never any one age, wherein the Church-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was not an Idoll, and the worſhip of God performed in that Societie, leprous, uncleane, poyſoned with Idolatry.

                        <p>But if we may ſpeake as you doe, A deviſed conſtitution is twofold, 1 Abſolute and in every reſpect, when neither Doctrine, Ordinances, office or perſons are of God: and this conſtitution is altogether falſe, a nullitie, an Idoll, if you pleaſe ſo to call it. 2 In part corrupt, maimed, defective, but having ſomething of God: and that which is done in ſuch a conſtitution is not falſe, a nullitie, tainted with the idolatry of the conſtitution. This diſtinction is neither deviſed, ſtrange, nor new, but that which hath ever more beene acknowledged in the Church of God, and is manifeſt in Scripture, if wee take the word, deviſed conſtitution, as this Author doth. For Heretikes and Schiſmatikes, though they be not of the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all number of them, that hold the intire profeſſion of divine truth in unitie, and in that reſpect be a falſe conſtitution; yet as they profeſſe the truth of God revealed in Chriſt, though

                        <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a falſe conſtitution, but baptiſme adminiſtred in that Church is not idolatry, nor a meere nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.

If we ſpeak abſolutely, or compare <hi>Rome</hi> with Churches truly Chriſtian, it is no true Church, but the Synagogue of Satan: But if we ſpeake of it in oppoſition to the Jewes, of Turkes, or other profeſſed Infidels, it hath ſo much of a viſible Church, as a man cannot ſay it is no Church at all; ſo much true doctrine is in it, as ſufficeth to ſupport the title of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and ſome ordinances are ſo adminiſtred, as that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid, they are meer nullities.</p>
                        <p>In the true Church many wicked ones are found, that are no leſſe prophane, ſacrilegious, enemies to peace, the vaſſals of Satan, poſſeſſed by the Divell, dead in ſin and accurſed of God, than heretiks or ſchiſmatiks, who yet for that they have that order, office, or degree of miniſterie, which is holy, doe no leſſe nor with leſſe effect adminiſter the holy ſacraments, than thoſe who are the ſamplars of all pietie and vertue.</p>
                        <p>The faithfull and holy Miniſters adminiſter and receive the Sacraments with good profit, and benefit to themſelves and others. The hypocriticall, with benefit to others, not to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The prophane being not put from their places, doe officiate with hurt to themſelves, ſcandall to others, but to the everlaſting comfort of them that partake worthily. The hereticall and idolatrous adminiſter the Sacraments, that are holy, and in their owne nature, the meanes, pledges, and aſſurances of ſalvation, but without benefit to themſelves and others, that continue in ſin. Thus the Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Martyrs, and faithfull, have held communion in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59346:48"/>of grace, with ſuch whoſe calling and converſation was not approved of God.</p>
                        <p>You ſay, the Martyrs firſt and laſt would not receive this diſtinction, leſt to ſave their lives, they ſhould loſe their ſoules, and you reckon up many, who, as you write, would rather give their bodies to the fire, than heare or receive the Sacrament, in falſe Churches or Societies. But in this you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh, as in every thing elſe, and hide the truth under the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguitie of the phraſe. The Martyrs laid downe their lives, rather than they would defile themſelves with idolatry, bee preſent at the Maſſe, or joyne themſelves as members of that Antichriſtian Synagogue: in all which they did, as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the faithfull ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt. But you cannot produce one Martyr of your opinion, who denyed, that any thing of God was to be found in thoſe Aſſemblies, or that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to joyne in the pure ordinances of God, with Societies ſeparated from ſpirituall Babylon, becauſe of ſome defect or may me in their Church conſtitution.</p>
                        <p>In the whole Catalogue of Martyrs, try if you can bring forth one, who in theſe things was of your minde. And what a vaine thing is it to pretend the example of all the Martyrs, when there is not one among them that doth approve your cauſe.

                        <p>You ſtruggle hard, as all men may perceive, but ſet not one foot forward. Our Church is an idoll, therefore wee muſt not hold communion with it: God hath promiſed no bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to his ordinances therein, becauſe the Church is an Idoll. This is your circle wherein you walke up and down. But to helpe you out of this mire, if it may be: 1.

We are ſeparated from Idols, wee heare the voice of the true ſhepheard, and follow not ſtrangers, but fly from them; we believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for ſalvation, and worſhip him ſincerely, according to his will. He ſtandeth at the doore knocking, and to ſuch as open unto him hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth unto them, and they ſup with him, and he with them. And therefore Chriſt is our Shepheard, our King, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and of his rich grace and love doth embrace us as his people, and the flock of his paſture, beareth our prayers, and accepteth our ſervice. This is our glory that Chriſt is ours, and we are his, and it were better for us to dye, than that our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying herein ſhould be made void.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, ſeeing this tearme, Falſe Church, is ſo familiar with you, we will conſider what it meaneth, and how farre it doth ſtand true, that God hath made no promiſe to bleſſe things done in a falſe Church. Theſe words, True and falſe Church, are uſed oft to ſignifie, as much as pure and corrupt, found and languiſhing Church. And as there is ſcarce a Church ſo pure, which hath not ſome impuritie, nor ſo true, which hath not ſome falſhood admixed: ſo there is no Church ſo falſe or impure, which hath not ſomewhat of God, or ſome ſupernaturall Chriſtian truth within it, For if no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall Chriſtian truth bee received or profeſſed, there is no Church. Infidels being cleane without the Church, deny and utterly reject the principles of Chriſtianitie. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes or falſe Chriſtians, in reſpect of generall truths which they openly profeſſe, are Chriſtians, or of the Church, but in reſpect of their particular errours, condemned of all men that be of ſound beliefe. A Church is not to be eſteemed falſe for ſome corruptions, nor impure for ſome diſorders, no more, than we account him a ſickly man who now and then findes ſome wearineſſe or diſtemper. Neither is a Church to be accounted true, becauſe of ſome truths which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
<note place="margin">Act. 2.41, 42, 46</note> worſhip, which they practiſe, or uſe of the Sacraments, which they retaine. The notes of a pure Church are, intire profeſſion of the Goſpell, and ſaving truth of God, the right
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59346:50"/>uſe of the Sacraments, holineſſe of converſation, the ſound preaching of the word of life, fervent and pure calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods name, ſubjection to their ſpirituall guides, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may bee directed and built forward in the wayes of life, mutuall communion in the ordinances of worſhip,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.11, 12.</note> and Chriſtian fellowſhip with all Saints, and true viſible Churches of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe Churches to which all theſe notes agree truelie, are to bee eſteemed pure in their meaſure: but thoſe to whom all doe not agree, or not ſo truely, they are to be eſteemed leſſe pure or true, and that in compariſon more or leſſe according as more or fewer of theſe notes, common, ſpeciall or proper, ſhall be found more or leſſe pure amongſt them.</p>
                        <p>Where all theſe notes are to be found purely, the Church is excellent for degree, pure and famous; where any of theſe is wanting or impure, the Church is ſo much defective or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, though it may be pure in compariſon of others.</p>
                        <p>The profeſſion of the true faith,
<note place="margin">Acts 14.22.23, 27</note> and the framing of our life and converſation according to the direction of the word, with the right adminiſtration of the Sacraments and comely order,
<note place="margin">Ier. 4.22. Mat. 13.14, 15. Iſa. 30.9, 10, 11. &amp; 5.7, 8, 9 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </note> are ſignes of a Church in a good ſtate and condition. But it may fall out, that the profeſſion of faith alone by publike preaching and hearing of the word, adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, prayers and thankſgiving doth take place, when good order is neglected, and if life degenerate from the profeſſion: for in this caſe ſhe ceaſeth not to be the true CHVRCH of Chriſt, ſo long as it pleaſeth him not to give her a Bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce.</p>
                        <p>True doctrine in all points, and the due and right admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments in all things according to the word both for ſubſtance and circumſtance, is the note of a pure Church, and in good plight. But true Doctrine in the maine grounds and Articles of faith, though mixt with defects and errours in other matters, not concerning the life and ſoule of Religion, and the right adminiſtration of the Sacraments for ſubſtance, though in the manner of diſpenſation ſome things be not ſo well ordered as they might and ought, are notes and markes of a true and ſound Church, though ſomewhat craſed in health and ſoundneſſe, by errors in doctrine, corruptions in the worſhip of God, and evils in life and manners.</p>
                        <p>A falſe Church is that which holds neither the truth of faith
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59346:51"/>intirely, nor the integrity of divine worſhip, nor comely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which God hath appointed for the government of his houſe, nor holineſſe of converſation. But addeth to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith, to that which is worſhipped, and to the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall means wherby God is worſhipped, and to the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, which God hath given for the direction of his people, or detracteth and perverteth the right ſenſe of faith, not conſidering that which is worſhipped as is meete, mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Ordinances of God, and transforming the lawfull manner of worſhip into another forme, and inverteth the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Commandement by corrupt gloſſes and ſiniſter interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which deſtroyeth the life and power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                        <p>One falſe Church may bee more corrupt and rotten than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as being more deepely tainted in matters of higher importance and more generally than another: as ſome may bee corrupt in matters of faith, others in doctrine and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip both,

                        <p>The true Church of God which is comparatively pure, may be called falſe though improperly, in reſpect of that corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in doctrine and manners, errours, ſchiſmes, diviſions, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition or prophanenes, which through humane frailty and negligence cleaveth unto it.</p>

                        <p>And a falſe Church may comparatively be called a Church true or pure in reſpect of them that be more groſſely defiled, as it hath more truth and purity in it.</p>
                        <p>Alſo the true Churches of God have ſometimes bin diſtinct viſible ſocieties from the falſe Churches, and by many degrees in themſelves more pure from tincture and infection, than at other times and ſome others have beene. As in the dayes of <hi>Abiah, Iudah</hi> was by many degrees more free from polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than afterwards.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Pauls</hi> time the integrity of <hi>Rome</hi> was famous: <hi>Corinth</hi> many wayes reproved: They of <hi>Galatia</hi> much more out of ſquare. But the true and Orthodox Church hath ſometimes beene ſo mixed with others in outward ſociety, that it hath beene hard to find in the whole world a diſtinct Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſound and intire profeſſors of all ſupernaturall truths, who joyned in the uſe of Gods Holy Ordinances, but the members of the true viſible Church were diſperſed and ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and mingled with falſe Chriſtians or falſe worſhippers in ſociety, and the true Church lay hid in the falſe.</p>
                        <p>Now to apply theſe things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. If by a falſe Church you underſtand a Church erring in points of faith exceeding dangerous, and corrupting the pure worſhip of God with reall Idolatry, with whom the faithfull may not lawfully hold Communion: yet then that which they have of God amongſt them, though not rightly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, is effectuall by the bleſſing of GOD according, to promiſe.</p>
                        <p>As Baptiſme adminiſtred by the Heretikes holding the forme of Baptiſme, and of Popiſh Prieſts, is true Baptiſme, and not to be reiterated.

                        <p>After theſe abominations were concluded, the firſt that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themſelves were the <hi>Waldenſes, Albigenſes,</hi> or poore men of <hi>Lyons,</hi> who withdrew themſelves from the ſocietie of the Romane Synagogue, and worſhiped God in diſtinct

And this (as the learned judge) was done, if not by Gods commandement, at leaſt by graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous indulgence. Vntill the time of the Trent Councell (ſaith one) the Church although oppugned with errours and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of divers kinds, oppreſſed with tyranny, did not pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently endure the tyranny of the Pope, and the impudency of the Fraterculi.

                        <p>It is here to be further noted, that neither the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> who firſt ſeparated, nor the reformed Churches which in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times caſt off the yoke of Antichriſt, and aboliſhed his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, did make ſuch a pure and perfect reformation in all things as was to be deſired.

                        <p>If you will tel us diſtinctly what you mean by falſe Churches you ſhall ſee your whole building to fall of it ſelf. For, if you underſtand therby every Church, that labours under ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, or corruption in gathering and conſtitution, doctrine, or diſcipline it is apparently falſe.

But if we call for proof of theſe accuſations, you are glad to fly off, and to play leaſt in ſight. Superſtition, falſe worſhip, idolatry is unlawfull, that you can ſay, and no man will deny it.

                        <p>Howſoever therefore the Non-conformiſts diſſent from others touching the Office and calling of Biſhops: as it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a degree of miniſtery above Paſtors and Miniſters of the whole Dioceſſe, who leave the care of Preaching to particular flockes, unto others, and challenge that as peculiar to themſelves which is common to others, or properly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to many: yet they never denyed the word Preached by them that profeſſe the intire faith, and the Sacraments admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by them, to be the true effectuall Ordinances of Ieſus Chriſt. And moſt that approve the calling of Biſhops, deny not that there may be a Presbytery, but that a Presbytery is ſo fit for a Monarchy, being of opinion, that the forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is left to the diſcretion of every Church. And both ſides profeſſe, that there is not any difference betwixt them, which may either deprive them of ſalvation by the death of CHRIST, or barre them from living brotherly and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly as members of one and the ſame Church.</p>
                        <p>It is a rule, you ſay. That no man can give more to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than hee hath himſelfe. But this rule of Law is unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully applyed, or elſe while you diſpute againſt one falſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery you ſet up another, or deſtroy the miniſtery altogether. For the community of the faithfull have not power to preach the Word, or adminiſter the Sacraments, and hee that derives his authority from them, which they have not to give, is no true Miniſter. If they be falſe Miniſters, who derive their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from them that have it not, then they that derive it from the Church as the Primitive and immediate ſubject muſt goe in that number. For the Church hath not that authority,

If the people and guides of the Church both conſent, they have no authoritie to call or conſecrate an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, covetous, profane, hereticall Miniſter, and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives authority from them that have it not to give, is no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and that which is done by him is of no validity, his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are not heard, the Sacraments adminiſtred by him are not ſeale of the covenants or internall communion with Chriſt or his faithfull people. A falſe Church or miniſtery hath no power to call and ordaine a Miniſter or to give him power to preach the pardon of ſinnes, or diſpenſe the ſeales of grace; and the authority granted by them that have it not is a meere blanke. Theſe and ſuch like are the proper conſequences of this rule miſapplyed; All which no fort of Chriſtians ever admitted as ſound and true. The Papiſts are very forward to challenge the reformed Churches as no true Churches, becauſe they have no true Miniſters, but ſuch as were ordained by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes or are fallen into hereſie. And yet when they have ſpent their breath they dare not deny, but baptiſme admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by Heretickes who hold intyre the forme of Baptiſme, is true, and ſo the Lords Supper and ordination likewiſe: For the impiety of the Miniſter cannot pollute the purity of divine myſteries, neither ſhall they be ineffectuall to the children of God, although diſpenſed by <hi>Iudas</hi> the Traytor. Heretickes have not (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) the remiſſion of ſinnes formally; but they have it miniſterially, as a ſervant who hath not one farthing of his owne, may carry many thouſands of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to ſome other man. In things naturall and artificiall the effect is not like to the inſtrument, but to the principall cauſe; as heate is the inſtrument of fire, though it have not the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall forme of fire, and the baptiſme which is adminiſtred, and the word which is preached of wicked men, is not the baptiſm or word of wicked men, but of Chriſt. <hi>Anatolius</hi> was conſecrated of <hi>Dioſcorus, Felix</hi> of the <hi>Arians.</hi> See <hi>Gratian: decret. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>qu.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 32.33, 34, 35, 36. 37, 47.</p>

But doe they only acknowledge ſo much? was not this evermore received for a truth in the ancient Church, that ordination received from heretikes, not erring in the maine fundamentall truths directly, was true and effectuall? Doe not all reformed Churches which have ſeparated from the abominations of Rome profeſſe that the firſt reformers amongſt them received ſome ordinary calling in the Church of Rome, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in that time of the viſible Church corrupted? For ſome of them were Biſhops, ſome Prieſts and Doctors ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the Vniverſities, and ordinarie Churches: many of them preached, the Goſpell and adminiſtred the Sacraments before excommunication or perſecution raiſed by the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faries, in that they were ſent unto, or ſet over ſeverall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or congregations, in which they ought to execute their office or miniſtration, therein they received commandement to preach the Goſpel.

<note place="margin">CAN. Stag. §. 3. p. 56.</note> for ſhould I ſpeake my conſcience, (it is your phraſe,) They are words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weight of reaſon. For ſtill you preſuppoſe the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Church of England to bee falſe and idolatrous, which is to beg, not to conclude the queſtion. But that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſuppoſed, let us ſee how you goe forward. In preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of the Goſpell by a falſe Miniſter, an Idolatrous act is performed, you ſay. But doth the Scripture ſay ſo? Do you read it in the Law, or in the Prophets, in the Apoſtles or in the Evangeliſts? The Scribes and Phariſees were falſe, Miniſters, but it was not an Idolatrous worke in them to expound the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or diſpence other Church ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, at that time commanded. The popiſh Prieſts and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are falſe Prophets, but the ſimple adminiſtration of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme by them is not an idolatrous act. The Miniſter that is prophane, and hateth to be reformed, is a falſe Miniſter, and hath nothing to doe to take the covenant of God into his mouth, but the Word preached by a treacherous <hi>Judas,</hi> proud <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> covetous <hi>Demas,</hi> or one that envieth the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Saints, and peace of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> is not an Idolatrous act. If it be Idolatrous in him that performeth it, yet it doth not follow, that it is idolatrous in them that joyne in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. Let it bee idolatrous in the prieſts, who deſpiſe knowledge, and live prophanely, put caſe <hi>Elies</hi> ſons, to offer
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59346:66"/>ſacrifice, it is idolatrous likewiſe for the people to appeare before God in his holy Temple.</p>
                        <p>That <hi>Vzziah</hi> committed a grievous offence, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the Prieſts office, all men thinke. In what reſpect all men conceive it to be an idolatrous act I cannot ſay: but all falſe Miniſters do not uſurpe the Prieſts office, as <hi>Vzziah:</hi> nor all things done by falſe Prophets,

Thus the Nonconformiſts, upon whoſe grounds you pretend to build your concluſions, let it be as the cenſure reporteth, that his words are of a Miniſter, which cannot preach Doth he doubt whether he be in any reſpect a a Miniſter or no, becauſe he ſaith, if I may ſo call him?

For it is commanded in the word, and acceptable ſervice unto God, the meanes to build up the Church: It is to hold communion with God, to reverence his name, to lay hold upon Chriſt and lodge him in our boſome: It ſheweth that a man is one of Chriſts ſheep, becauſe hee heareth his voice, and a member of his ſheepfold, the ſervant of the moſt high God: it manifeſteth love and zeale to God, and is ordinarily bleſſed to the ſoul and conſcience of the dutifull hearer.

                        <p>The Treatiſer (as you call him) propounding this objection of yours, that the Scriptures of the old and new Teſtament, warne Gods people of falſe prophets, which the Miniſters of that Church are, having an unlawfull calling, maketh anſwer, 1 By denying that the Scriptures warn men ſimply not to hear falſe Prophets, <hi>i.e.</hi> any falſe prophet whatſoever. And then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds a diſtinction of fals Prophets; that ſome fals Prophets were in the Church of God, and theſe might be heard, as they had place in the Church, till they were orderly repreſſed, or at leaſt diſcovered; others were not in the Church, but ſimply without, and theſe were not to be heard. This is the plaine and direct anſwer of the Treatiſer, as every man may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that is not groſly ignorant, or wilfully blind. But ſee how you jeſt and dally with it unconſcionably when you had nothing to anſwer. 1. You ſay he <hi>peremptorily denyeth the whole objection, and ſo conſequently affirmes, that all falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets may be heard.</hi> But what new Logicke is this, whereby we may learne to draw ſuch conſequences. In former times it hath beene thought reaſonable to deny an univerſall negative or affirmative propoſition, when they hold not true in all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals. No falſe prophet is to be heard. This propoſition may juſtly be benyed, if any falſe Prophet may be heard, though all might not. 2 You adde preſently and <hi>with the ſame breath, He unſaith what hee ſaid before.</hi> But this is a palpable and groſſe calumny: For he ſaid not, that all falſe Prophets might be heard by all, nor denyeth what hee granted at the firſt, that ſome may be heard: but plainly implyeth a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of falſe Prophets, which I can hardly thinke you did not perceive, though you be pleaſed ſo to pervert his words.</p>

This practice is Antichriſtian, borrowed from the vileſt bondſlaves of that man of ſinne, if not from Satan himſelfe.

<note place="margin">Id. p. 121.</note> and whoſoever is a falſe Prophet, cannot be a true Prophet of God.

For truth is before falſe-hood, and good before evill, and habite before privation. But you miſerably apply that Rule to the firſt judgment of the ſeparated Church in <hi>London,</hi> concerning the hearing of the Word preached, in our Engliſh Aſſemblies, as if it muſt bee trueſt, becauſe it was firſt, and their after judgement adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, becauſe it followed.</p>

<q>To rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the effect of things (you ſay) is unſound, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concludable by the Scriptures.

                     </p>
                     <p>But your Piſtoler argueth from the effect, not from the event, from the proper effect, not the effect by accident, as you might eaſily perceive, but that you tooke liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride what you could not anſwer. Thus he argueth, The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine taught in the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the ſound and true doctrine of ſalvation, profitable to beget faith, and to build men forward unto life eternall (not by accident, but of it ſelfe) and is ordinarily bleſſed of God to that end and purpoſe: Therefore it is not unlawfull to heare the word preached in their aſſemblies. What you talke of <hi>Caines</hi> murder, <hi>Iudas</hi> his Treachery, the good that comes by Schiſmes and Hereſies, is only to pleaſe your ſelfe with by-matters: for the argument is drawne from the proper effect, in reſpect of meanes inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, appointed and bleſſed of God.</p>
                     <p>This Canon is true, if truly applyed, and rightly limited,

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59346:78"/>the word which doth not ordinarily beget is not to bee heard. For the word is but a morall cauſe or inſtrument of faith and repentance, whereby the Spirit worketh not neceſſarily, but at pleaſure. If therefore the Spirit worke by the word as his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, it is of God and wee are bound to heare it: But if God worke not by it, effectually to ſaving converſion, it is of him notwithſtanding: So this affirmative is true, ſinne deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>To theſe particulars I will adde one more, whereby we may learne what we are to expect and looke for at your hands. I think to make known unto thee (thus you write) what hapned about ſeven years paſt in England. There was a Gentleman of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickſhire,</hi> by name M. <hi>Edward Greſwold</hi> a man very religious, as many beſides my ſelfe can teſtifie: Hee and I being boſome friends (or to uſe his owne common ſaying, our hearts being as <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Ionathans</hi> knit together,) upon juſt cauſe we both left the pariſh aſſemblies. He afterward by the meanes of ſome craftie men, was perſwaded unto hearing againe: upon this he fell into great trouble of Spirit, and could have no feeling aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of any peace with God: remaining thus a while, at length he ſent a letter by his ſervant unto me (the which I have kept a long time by me) in this letter he largely acknowledgeth his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and among other paſſages writes thus: Ah you are happy but I by my fall am miſerable and wretched, and for the preſent time, I feele my ſoule to be no otherwiſe, than if I were in Hell, &amp;c. ever ſince I went to their aſſemblies, I have obſerved the Lords hand againſt me. &amp;c. Wherefore I beſeech you by the mercies of God, ſet a day apart for me, and ſeeke the Lord by faſting and praying, that the water-flood overflow me not, &amp;c. what his refreſhings were after this I cannot ſay, the report is, that to his changing he had ſad and ſorrowfull dayes: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I am confident, that his ſoule is with Chriſt in paradiſe. As I am writing this, I thinke of the words of the Prophet, My fleſh trembleth for feare of thee, and I am afraid of thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He that is wiſe will conſider of theſe things: For as one ſaith, providing before, is better than repenting afterward.

This is your Relation and the uſe you make thereof.</p>
                     <p>But if you know not how it fared with this diſtreſſed Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, thus it was: He ſhut up himſelfe and his children in his houſe, and would come at no man, nor ſuffer any man to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59346:81"/>come at him, leſt hee ſhould communicate with them in their ſin. Suſtenance for himſelfe and his Children was brought unto them, and put in at ſome hole or window, but hee ſuffered no man to come in to miniſter unto them, no not when his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and he himſelfe lay ſick in great miſery. When by order his houſe was broken open (for the Juſtices of peace in conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his caſe were conſtrained thereunto) two of his children were found dead in the houſe, and one had lyen ſo long unburied, that the body was corrupted and did annoy the roome. The Gentleman himſelfe ſick on his bed, in wofull plight. His Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he had gone thorough, and cut out the contents, titles and every thing, but the very Text it ſelfe. This I have received from credible hands, and it is a matter known through that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie where he lived. And if you marke it wiſely, you may ſee the originall of his ſorrow and heavineſſe, was not from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Word in our aſſemblies, but from your principles, which he had too deeply drunk in, and out of a deſire to keepe and obſerve, made himſelfe deſolate. It is very likely he thought with himſelfe, that if by hearing the doctring of grace hee did communicate with men in their ſins, much more was guilt contracted by civill converſings. And if you will try it in right reaſon, I cannot ſee how that conſequence from your principles can be avoided. Now he deſirous to ſtick to what he had learned, and not to delude himſelf with vaine diſtinctions, as too many of the ſeparation doe, fel firſt into deepe perplexitie, and then at laſt came unto that deſperate concluſion, to ſhut up himſelfe and his children. It is one of your principles, That all humane devices whatſoever in the worſhip of God are idolatrous: and therefore conceiving the contents of the Chapters, and titles of the bookes to be of men, hee cut them out. And further it is likely he would have gone, if his thoughts had reached further in this matter. It was your great ſinne to perſwade him to ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and it is your great ſinne now to impute the cauſe of his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, diſtreſſe, and anguiſh, to his hearing the Word in our ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when as it was the naturall fruit of his raſh and ſinfull ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or of thoſe poſitions, whereupon his ſeparation was builded, wherein if he was not firſt inſtructed, he had been built up by you. Let falſe Churches be ſhops of wickedneſſe, and the ſhambles of the Saints: In our ſocieties the doctrine of faith and pietie is ſoundly and purely taught, our adverſaries being judges: a thouſand thouſands can teſtifie by experience what oule-raviſhing comforts, and ſweet communion with God may
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59346:81"/>be had therein. When you wrote theſe things, you had juſt cauſe, to take ſhame and ſorrow, that you had brought a poore ſoule thus into the ſnare of your ſeducements: but to take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion thereby to encourage others, harden your ſelfe in an evill way, and to revile and ſlander the heritage of the Lord, is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of how great perverſneſſe? You are confident he is with Chriſt in paradiſe, and I will not goe about to leſſen your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence therein. But if you may bee confident of him, may not we be confident of the Martyrs, who dyed cheerefully for the teſtimonie of the Lord Jeſus, being profeſſed members of our ſocieties? Infallible knowledge of anothers ſalvation we chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge not, but what you can pronounce confidently of one, we may with equall or greater confidence pronounce of many, who laid downe their lives for the truth of God. And therefore the reaſon drawne from the practice of the Martyrs, profeſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Antichriſt, who lived and dyed members of our Societies, and are received into glory, to prove that our ſocieties are not Antichriſtian, idolatrous, falſe worſhip, is neither abſurd nor childiſh, howſoever you are pleaſed to ſpurne and kick at it. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe your owne manner of arguing implyed here,

                     <p>As for the particular point in hand, the authors alledged by you, ſpeake nothing to your purpoſe. For men may run when they bee not ſent two wayes. Firſt, when they are outwardly called, but not inwardly qualified, as with knowledge, truth, holineſſe, or care to doe the duties of their place, and theſe are lawfull and unlawfull Miniſters both: lawfull as Miniſters of Gods providence, for the puniſhment of ſome, and the good of others, unlawfull as not approved of God in their place and ſtanding. Secondly, when they have no manner of calling, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſet apart by men in authoritie, nor received by the Church, nor qualified as they ought, and theſe are every way unlawfull. Againe falſe Prophets are of two ſorts. I Such as ſpring up in the Church, teaching corrupt or perverſe things, but either not diſcovered, or not convicted, or not caſt out. Theſe the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full muſt not believe, though they may not forſake or caſt off the Societies where ſuch are tolerated. 2. Such as teach damnable doctrines, are not ſet apart to offices falſe and idolatrous, and either never were in the ſocietie of the true Church, or bee lawfully convicted, and juſtly caſt out, and with theſe the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full muſt hold no communion,</p>
                     <p>This is that which the learned teach, as it hath beene ſhewed,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59346:82"/>but it makes nothing at all to your purpoſe. For you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prove from Scripture, reaſon or Nonconformiſts princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, either that the miniſterie of the Church of England is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely falſe, or that any Miniſters in the Church be falſe in the ſecond acceptation of the word.</p>

Againe, it is a queſtion whether the godly in the Jewiſh Church, having by hearing diſcovered the Scribes and Phariſees to be ſtrangers, that is, falſe Prophets, might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heare them againe.

But howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the caſe is not eaſily to be determined, conſidering the ſtate of that Church and time: yet this is cleare to all men of ſound judgement, that in the Churches now under the Goſpell, falſe Prophets may not be ſuffered: But after due and orderly convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (being found ſo, and obſtinate) they are to bee rejected, and ſo no outward hearing of them any more. Whence briefly let theſe things be noted. Firſt, that the effects may be right and lawfull, when the inſtruments are wrong and unlawfull in themſelves, and that a man may lawfully communicate, in the effects of ſuch actions, whoſe inſtruments are unlawfull. For the Scribes and Phariſees were unlawfull inſtruments, by your own confeſſion,
<note place="margin">

                        </note> but the effects of their miniſterie, in which the faithfull might and did lawfully communicate. A falſe Prophet not diſcovered, not convicted orderly, before he can be deemed obſtinate and caſt forth, is an unlawfull inſtrument, but you will not ſay, the effects of his Miniſterie are unlawfull, and not to be communicated in. I might here adde, that is unskillfull to confound inſtruments and working cauſes, or linke them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as if there were the ſame reaſon of both, ſeeing all inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not working cauſes. Secondly the Miniſters of the Church of England, have not duely and orderly beene convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of corruption in doctrine, eſpecially in points fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, or that their place and ſtanding is unlawfull: much leſſe can they be eſteemed obſtinate. They were never caſt out by the faithfull, and true members of the Church, but approved, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and reverenced by them: All reformed Churches, all
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59346:82"/>the faithfull in the reformed Churches doe acknowledge them the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, approve their ſtanding, reverence their gifts, hold communion with them, profeſſe the ſame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which they maintaine, and praiſe God for his bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their labours. And now conſider with what uprightneſſe and integritie you have alleadged theſe Authors, againſt the hearing of the word in our Engliſh Aſſemblies, as if all the Miniſters of the Church were falſe Prophets, convicted, obſtinate, and outed the Church.</p>

And if you ſhall be deſperate herein, your forwardneſſe will move no wiſe man; for Religion is to be learned from the truth of God, and not from the high ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of inconſiderate men. The Non-conformiſts can prove the Religion and worſhip of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be of God, not by petty reaſons and colourable ſhewes (which they leave to them that maintaine a bad cauſe) but by pregnant evidence from the word of truth; not by ſimilitudes, allegories, and forced interpretations of Scripture (as you diſpute againſt it) but by plaine texts of Scripture, and ſound reaſon deduced therefrom, againſt which the gates of hell ſhall never prevaile.</p>

Abuſes that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the generall nature of abuſe may be coloured, with the ſame pretences, when they be not of the ſame weight, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or degree; the one may be ſmall, the other hainous. The ſame diſtinction may be brought to countenance the vileſt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and a petty errour, if I may ſo ſpeake. Hereſie and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry are both talkative, and who doubts but corrupt wits can ſay much in defence of both; ſhall we thence conclude, that errour or hereſie are both one; every abuſe is groſſe idolatry. The Author, you quote, was not ſo unadviſed: His drift was onely to ſhew the vanitie of ſuch excuſes, and not to match the things pleaded for with <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Idolatry, as hath been ſhewed before. But let us ſee whether you can alledge any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable ſhew, or petty reaſon, to prove our worſhip to be falſe and idolatrous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The whole forme of the Church-ſervice is borrowed from the Papists, peiced and patched together without reaſon or order of edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: yea not onely is the forme of it, taken from the Church of Antichriſt, but ſurely the matter alſo: For none can deny but it was culled and picked out of that popiſh dunghill, the portius and vile Maſſe-booke, full of all abhominations. From three Romiſh Channels, I ſay, was it raked together, namely, the Breviarie, out of which the common prayers are taken; out of the Rituall or booke of Rites, the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, Buriall, Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Viſitation of the ſick are taken; and out of the Maſſe-booke, are the Conſecration of the Lords Supper, Collects, Goſpels, and Epiſtles. <q>And for this cauſe it is, that the Papists like ſo well of the Engliſh Maſſe, (for ſo King <hi>James</hi> uſed to call it) and makes them ſay, Surely the Romiſh is the true and right Religion.</q> Elſe the Heretiques in England would never have received ſo much of it. For ſome have avouched it to my face (ſaith the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Curtaine of Church-power) that the ſervice there is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59346:86"/>nothing to the Maſſe in the Engliſh; others that it wants nothing but the Popes conſecration. Theſe things thus retrived, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thought that popiſh Kings and Princes would be the leſſe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; what marvaile, ſeeing the Jeſuites themſelves are ſo well pleaſed with the ceremonies and ſervice, that I heard one of them (God is my witneſſe herein) make it his hope, that the maintenance of them againſt the Puritans, would make England the ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to Rome in the reſt.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, To note a bare order, methode, or phraſe, wherein divine Service is performed: And in this ſenſe, the Nonconformiſts never ſaid, That all formes of worſhip not preſcribed are falſe, or deviſed worſhip. For they know, that no forme is determined and preſcribed of God preciſely in all parts of his worſhip, and where none is ſet apart by his Majeſtie, it is a breach of his Commandement, and deviſed worſhip, to place an opinion of worſhip in the ſimple order or phraſe of ſpeech uſed in prayer, or adminiſtration of holy things.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59346:87"/>
               <p>The Nonconformiſts condemne not a Liturgie, or ſtinted forme of prayer, but deſire that all things therein might be ordered as doth tend moſt to edification. Whatſoever excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they have taken againſt our Booke of Common-prayer, they never diſliked the uſe of it, ſo far as they judged it ſound and good. They doe not condemne it wholly, but finde fault with it, as in ſome points diſagreeing with the word of God. What hath beene their ſeeking from time to time? a razing of the Communion Booke! No; but a purging and filing of it, after the patterne of that care, which former examples ſet us. The Booke of Common-prayer, they condemne not as a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ungodly Booke, much leſſe the Service as falſe, devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and idolatrous; but they have and doe uſe the booke, and profeſſe their readineſſe ſo to doe, onely they deſire to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed in ſome things, which they judge to be amiſſe.</p>

                  <q>Judge then your ſelfe, whether it be not a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous calumny in you to write, That our ſtinted ſervice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by the Biſhop, and tranſlated from the Maſſe, is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by our owne Writers, to be a falſe and forged worſhip, and that it is even ſo, I appeale to many of your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: For why doe you loath to uſe the ſame in your Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, but becauſe you know it is not the incenſe made by fire from the Altar of the Lord.</q> Is it a ſmall thing thus to ſlander and reproach the ſervants of Chriſt, contrary to their writings, profeſſions, and practices, and your owne Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? And what a vaine ſurmiſe is this, that becauſe they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to uſe it in their houſes, therefore in conſcience they know it to be ſtrange incenſe? As if many things might not be forborne, which in themſelves are lawfull? In reading the Scriptures a Chriſtian may uſe one tranſlation, when he doth not condemne others as abhomination. I may preſume, in private you make not uſe of the Lords prayer, and ſo of ſome others; and yet you would not, that another ſhould fit in your conſcience and judge, that you know it is not the incenſe made by fire from the Altar of the Lord? Or if you be ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, ſober and well adviſed men will admit no ſuch concluſions. But here you muſt remember againe, that no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode, order, or phraſe of ſpeech in prayer, left undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God, can truely be called or eſteemed the incenſe made by fire. Prayer it ſelfe, and not the phraſe of ſpeech, whether deviſed by another or by our ſelves, is reſembled thereby.</p>
               <p>But the whole forme (you ſay) of the Engliſh-Church-ſervice-Book, is borrowed out of the Maſſe-Book, picked and culled out of the Dunghill, as the Nonconformiſts write. You adde, That not onely the forme, but the matter alſo was taken out of the Maſſe-Booke.</p>
               <p>It is true, the Nonconformiſts ſay, it was in great part pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and culled out of the Maſſe-booke; but it followeth not thence, that either it is, or was eſteemed by them a deviſed or falſe worſhip; for many things conteined in the Maſſe-booke it ſelfe, are good and holy. A Pearle may be found upon a Dunghill; we cannot more credit the man of ſinne, than to ſay, that every thing in the Maſſe-booke is deviliſh and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59346:88"/>For then it ſhould be Antichriſtian to pray unto God, in the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, to read the Scriptures, to profeſſe many fundamentall divine truths neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: If any have miſliked the Booke, becauſe it hath too much likelihood to the Maſſe-booke; that hath not beene the judgement of the Nonconformiſts alone, others have ſaid and written as much, who never yet condemned the uſe of the Booke, or all things therein conteined. Popery is a ſcab or leproſie which cleaveth unto the Church: It ſtandeth moſtly, in erroneous, faultie, groſſe and abhominable ſuperſtructions upon the true foundation, whereby they poyſon or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the foundation it ſelfe. But take away the ſuperſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the foundation remaineth: remove the leproſie, and the man is ſound. Many ſupernaturall divine truths of God are mixed in the Popiſh Synagogue; as pure gold with much droſſe or earth, which the refiner is to purge and ſeparate, but not to caſt away. Our ſervice was picked and culled out of the Maſſe-booke, you ſay; and ſo it might, and yet be free from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> and tincture, from all ſhew and appearance of evill; though the Maſſe-booke it ſelfe was fraught with all manner of abhominations. For if Antichriſt fit in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and profeſſe himſelfe the ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, of neceſſitie, ſome treaſures, riches and jewels of the Church muſt be gathered into his den, which being collected, purged, and refined, might ſerve to adorne the chaſte ſpouſe of Chriſt. Neither in ſo doing doth the Church honour Antichriſt, but challenge her owne right. If ſhee retaine ought that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Antichriſt, that is her ſtaine and blemiſh: but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of that, which Chriſt, the King and Bridegroome of his Church hath given, as her wealth or ornament, muſt not be imputed a fault.

                  </note> how comes it to have thoſe things, which are ſo directly contrary to the Maſſe, that both cannot poſſibly ſtand together. In our booke of Common-prayer, we pray to God onely in the mediation
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59346:89"/>of Jeſus Chriſt, and in a knowne language: We profeſſe that Chriſt by one oblation of himſelfe once for all, hath made a full, perfect, and ſufficient ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of the whole world: that he hath commanded a perpetuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his death and paſſion in that his ordinance of the Supper: and that the Sacrament is to be adminiſtred in both kinds; the Miniſter and the people communicating together: were theſe things taken out of the Maſſe-booke? The Church of Rome joyneth the two firſt Commandements in one, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the ſecond, thereby to cloake their Idolatry in the worſhipping of Images: But the common-prayer-booke of the Church of <hi>England</hi> divideth them into two, therein fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing (two of the Fathers at moſt excepted) all Antiquitie, and fetteth downe the words of the ſecond Commandement at large. The Church of Rome teacheth, that in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Euchariſt, the body and bloud of Chriſt is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and eaten carnally; that as much is received in one kinde, as in both, and that in the Maſſe Chriſt is offered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

In the Maſſe the Prieſt receiveth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, the people ſtanding by, gazing on: but the Miniſter and people are appointed with us to communicate together; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the inſtitution of Chriſt, and practice of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church. We make the communion of the Euchariſt properly a Sacrament: They, a Sacrament and a Sacrifice propitiatory: They celebrate at an Altar: wee at a Table; according to the example of our Saviour Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and the primitive Church in the pureſt times. Wee pray for the living; They for the living and dead. And if theſe be not points directly and expreſly contrary to the Romane ſervice, Rome is much departed from her ſelfe.</p>

                  <hi>Carriers</hi> pretence in that particular is a meere jugling trick, that he might inſinuate, a change of Religion, might be made among us without any great alteration, which is as likely as the light ſhould be turned into darkneſſe and not eſpied. If many points of Popery be not condemned expreſly in the Catechiſme, or Service-booke (which are for the inſtruction of the ſimple in the grounds of Religion, and the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy things of God, and not to ſhew what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in Religion) yet ſo many points are there taught di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the foundation of Popery that it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Popery ſhould ſtand, if they take place.

               <p>It is mone proper to ſay, the Maſſe was added to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer, than that our common-prayer was taken out of the Maſſe-booke: For moſt things in our common-prayer, were to be found in the Liturgies of the Church, long before the Maſſe, whereof wee ſpeake, was heard of in the world. And the Maſſe was patched up by degrees, and added to the Liturgie of the Church, now one peice, then another; ſo that the ancient truths and holy Liturgies were at laſt ſtained with the Idoll of the Maſſe,

For in the firſt ten yeares of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> there was ſweet conſent amongſt brethren. The Pope durſt not curſe, the Goſpell flouriſhed and was glorifyed: the Papiſts durſt not oppoſe themſelves, and I thinke there was not a man that thought of ſeparation. The preſſing of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and conformitie in the tenth yeare of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> Reigne, was that which brought in all the troubles and contentions following. For after that Brethren wrote one againſt another, the Papiſts they fell backe to their vomit, and in proceſſe of time, and not long after, ſome of fiery ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits advanced the Controverſies to ſuch an height, as they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke their brethren, renounced their Mother, and drew themſelves into voluntary ſeparation, or ſchiſme. Which rents have beene encreaſed unto this day by the violent urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſubſcription and conformitie on the one fide, and the maintenance of that raſh and ſinfull departure on the other. But theſe things convince not our ſervice to be idolatrous.</p>
               <p>In few words, if our publique worſhip be falſe and deviſed, it muſt be, either becauſe it is a ſtinted or ſet Liturgie, deviſed by man, or for ſome ſpeciall reaſon in reſpect of the former matter. If becauſe it is a ſtinted or ſet Liturgie deviſed by man, then it is in vaine to ſay, it is picked out of the Maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booke, or it pleaſeth the Papiſts, or the Pope would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it: For this doth not make it deviſed worſhip, but it is deviſed worſhip, becauſe it is a ſet or ſtinted forme: And then the ſame ſentence muſt paſſe againſt all ſet formes of Pſalmes, Bleſſings, Confeſſions, and Catechiſmes. Then the publique worſhip of all the Churches of God throughout the whole world, for the ſpace of this fourteene hundred yeares, if not more, was falſe, deviſed and idolatrous. If in reſpect of the peculiar matter or forme, then either the bare forme of words, order, and methode, muſt be a part of worſhip, or the matter and ſubſtance of prayers and adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, be forged and deviſed worſhip, neither of which was ever ſaid by any Nonconformiſts, nor can be avouched with colour of truth.

And of this their judgement there is evident ground: for we muſt not approve the leaſt error (though in it ſelfe never ſo harmleſſe) for truth, becauſe that were to lie againſt the truth, and the God of truth needeth not my lie: But many things muſt be tolerated, when it is not in our power to amend them, which we cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, otherwiſe we muſt hold communion with no Church or ſocietie in the world.

If the Church ſhall deny communion to any member, becauſe he will not approve the leaſt ſinne, or acknowledge the leaſt knowne errour for truth, in that caſe the Church is ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, which doth caſt out ſuch a member, and not the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which doth ſuffer himſelfe injuriouſly to be caſt out.

You make him to ſay, becauſe we muſt flie from Idols, therefore wee cannot communicate in the worſhip of God
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59346:96"/>where the Croſſe is uſed without ſinne. He ſaith, Men muſt keepe themſelves pure from Idolothites, and not partake in the uſe of them, but not ſeparate from the Church or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of grace, becauſe ſuch rites or ceremonies are uſed in the adminiſtration: you cleane contrary make him to ſay, That men cannot communicate in the ordinances, or worſhip God in that ſocietie, where ſuch things are practiſed, but of neceſſitie they muſt communicate in the ſinne. He teacheth, That he that uſeth the Idolothite or materiall Idoll, is not an Idolater, becauſe he doth not uſe it idolatrouſly: but you make the Nonconformiſts to ſay, that it is an idolatrous worſhip, and that it defileth the true worſhip of God, to all that are preſent. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Parker</hi> extendeth the guilt of participation in part onely, to him that uſeth the Idolothite, you make him to affirme, that every one preſent at the worſhip, doth communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in his offence. Perhaps you will ſay, it is your inference upon his words: But the conſequence is abſurd and ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe: And to charge men to affirme directly as a principle, what you would inferre contrary to their expreſſe words, is far from honeſt and plaine dealing.</p>

But if bare preſence be approbation, how
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59346:97"/>can we hold communion with that Church, wherein any thing is left, which is by participation idolatrous, when this is that which the Nonconformiſts impute to the Croſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, that it is by participation idolatrous in them that uſe it. And if the reaſon following be well weighed (though in it ſelfe it hath neither weight nor ſubſtance) it will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh this: For if bare preſence be approbation, why ſhould not the perſonall ſinnes of the Miniſter hurt the people! or why are they not guilty of his perſonall ſinnes by participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when they communicate with him in the worſhip of God where they are practiced, as in prayer, preaching, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacraments, reading the Scriptures, &amp;c. Preſence in the Idoll-Temple at Idoll-worſhip is ſinfull, though in heart men pretend to deteſt Idolatry: vaine, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe preſence where Idolothites are uſed, as to eate of things ſacrificed to Idols in the place of their Idoll-banquet, or to ſit downe, though he doe not eate, is ſcandalous and offenſive: but preſence at Gods worſhip, which God hath commanded, where Chriſt is preſent to meete, welcome and bleſſe his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, though ſome things by participation Idolatrous be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained or uſed therein is neither ſinfull nor offenſive, it carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no evill appearance of approbation or conſent.</p>
               <p>This diſtinction of perſonall and miniſteriall ſinnes, as it is here applied, I never found in the writings of Nonconformiſt, and in it ſelfe it is a meere invention and device, which hath no ground from Scripture, and muſt have no place in Divinitie. For if the Miniſter be ignorant, proud, careleſſe, prophane, corrupt in judgement, ſuperſtitious in ſome obſervations, be theſe ſinnes perſonall or publique and Miniſteriall. If perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, then ſhould not they hurt the people, if this be true which here you affirme: But when you are directly croſſe to your ſelfe throughout your whole booke. If publique and miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, then the people are guilty of the Miniſters ignorance, careleſneſſe, pride, paſſion, indiſcretion, &amp;c. And if theſe be publique and miniſteriall, I deſire to know what is a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and what a miniſteriall fault. If a Miniſter in preaching or prayer put up a raſh petition, or deliver a raſh ſentence, give a weake reaſon, an unſound tryall, uſe vaine repetitions, a confuſed methode; if he miſ-interpret the Scripture, or doe not ſoundly deduce his doctrines out of the Text he taketh upon him to expound; if he divide it not aright, or ſome way
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59346:97"/>miſapply it; are theſe publique and miniſteriall or perſonall and private faults, if perſonall, I deſire to know what makes a fault miniſteriall and publique, and ſee it proved. If that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is done by a Miniſter in preaching and prayer, bleſſing and adminiſtration of the Sacraments be not miniſteriall, I know not what is to be called miniſteriall. If they be publique and miniſteriall, then whoſoever communicates with a Miniſter in the worſhip of God, he is guilty of all the ſins publiquely committed by him in this kind, if that diſtinction be of any worth. Which if it be granted, (If I may judge of your preaching by your writing) it is high time for all your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to haſt from you, for you miſ-alleadge Scripture, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the godly, ſpeake evill of the wayes of God, teach many falſhoods, and whiles they joyne with you in the worſhip of God, they are partakers of your tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p>The expoſition which is made of publique and miniſteriall faults, to wit, ſuch as he performeth for the people to God, is as ſtrange, if not more ſtrange then the diſtinction it ſelfe, as it is applyed. For in preaching the Word, and reading the Scripture, a miniſteriall fault may be committed, which is not performed for the people to God. In prayer, the faults of the Miniſter are not ever miniſteriall, if we may beleeve the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named diſtinction, and yet prayer is an action performed for the people to God. And let that deſcription ſtand, and the uſe of our ceremonies are no miniſteriall faults; for they are neither performed for the people unto God, nor from God unto the people, as the Church profeſſeth. But I have ſtood too long about theſe things, becauſe in the firſt Chapter the contrary hath been ſhewed at large.</p>
               <p>And if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Bates</hi> be truely alledged in this particular, that bare preſence in his conceit was approbation, yet this is a peece of cunning in you not very commendable, that you bring the private judgement of one man, as if it was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon principle of the chiefeſt Inconformiſts.

                     <p>What the Nonconformiſts will ſay to this argument you know not, but hitherto they have ſaid nothing, or as good as nothing. It is well you ſay not both Propoſitions are theirs, as you doe in the former with as little truth, as if you had ſaid it here. But if you had peruſed their writings againſt Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as you have obſerved what ſharp words they let fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the corruptions in our Church and Liturgie, you might have knowne, that they ſay ſomewhat, and ſomewhat to the purpoſe, not worthy your anſwer, but what can never be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered: Firſt, Diſcipline, they ſay, is taken two wayes. Firſt, Largely, for the whole order pertaining to the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and governing of a Church, the ordering of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and manner of men. And in this ſenſe,

                           <hi>Bilſon, perpet. Ch. govern. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 3. Order and Diſcipline the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nurſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all peace and quietneſſe, as well in divine as in humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp; aſſemblies, though it be not the life or ſpirit that quickneth the Church: yet doth it faſten and knit the members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as joynts and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes do the parts of our bodies. <hi>Id. ca.</hi> 9. The Goſpell muſt be preached, the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts muſt be frequented, for which purpoſe ſome muſt be taken to the publique ſervice, and miniſtery of the Church, &amp;c. Neither onely the lack of the Word and Sacraments, but the prophanation and abuſe of either, how greatly doth it endanger the ſtate and welfare of the whole Church of Chriſt? yea, the caſting of holy things to dogs, and of pearles before ſwine, how dreadfull a judgement doth it procure, as well to the conſenters as preſumers? A little Leaven ſowreth the whole maſſe: So that power to ſend Labourers into Gods harveſt, and to ſeparate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſons for defiling the myſteries and aſſemblies of the faithfull, muſt be retained and uſed in the Church of Chriſt, unleſſe we will turne the houſe of God into a den of theeves, &amp;c. Act. 2.41, 42.44, 45, 46, 47. &amp; 11.20, 21.26. &amp; 13.43.48. &amp; 14.1.21, 22, 23.</note> Diſcipline is neither the matter nor forme of the Church, but an inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble propertie, and ſo there can be no Church without ſome Diſcripline. Secondly, It is taken ſtrictly, for the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the cenſures. in which ſenſe, it is not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the being, but to the well-being and ſafetie of the Church. Secondly, They anſwer that by divine right the power of the keyes is given to every compleat, Apoſtolicall Church, but the execution of this power may be wanting,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59346:101"/>either through their negligence, or becauſe they are hindred; as in <hi>Sardis, Thyatira, Epheſus, &amp;c.</hi> And this is to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for the Queſtion is of the power to execute the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Chriſt, and not of the ſimple right to execute it. And in your opinion the execution of Diſcipline is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the being of the Church, without which it can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be gathered, nor ſubſiſt. Take your owne compariſon, unleſſe the body doe both receive food, and purge out excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is not poſſible it ſhould ſubſiſt and live. If therefore <hi>Sardis, Pergamus, Thyatira, &amp;c.</hi> continued the true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt, when the greater ſort would not, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could not purge out excrements, or all were groſſely neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, it followeth that the execution of diſcipline or power to execute diſcipline, is not abſolutely neceſſary to the being of the Church. Thirdly, The Church of <hi>England</hi> wanteth not the diſcipline of Chriſt for ſubſtance either in reſpect of right or execution, though it be not adminiſtred as it ought. Theſe are the Anſwers which they give, and they are too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie to be ſpurned away with ſcorne, when ever you ſhall try their weight.</p>
                     <p>Thus I might diſmiſſe your firſt band, as being put to flight already. But I will ſpend a little time to examine both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. And for the firſt it is to be noted, that the word <hi>Church</hi> (to let paſſe other ſignifications) is taken: Firſt, For the communitie of the faithfull few or many, two, three, or more, men or women, without guides or officers; for belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers diſperſed and ſcattered by perſecution, ſpoyled of their guides, or ſuch as being newly called never had guides ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, are yet the true Church of Chriſt. Secondly, The ſocietie of the faithfull, joyning together in the ordinances of worſhip under a lawfull Paſtour is a true Church, though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in many officers and ordinances required to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Church. Thirdly, A
<note n="c" place="margin">
                           <hi>Bilſon. ibid. ca.</hi> 1. The internall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment that God hath by his Spirit and truth in the hearts of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, is the true kingdom of chriſt, cannot be varied, is not queſtioned in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But there is a neceſſitie alſo of externall gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of meete men, and repelling of unmeete, to be truſted with the heavenly treaſures of the Word and Sacraments. As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the good uſing and right dividing of ſo precious Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells committed to their charge.</note> competent number of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people joyned in ſocietie under lawfull Paſtours, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and Elders, to watch over, rule, feed and guide them in the waies of God, are a true and compleat conſtituted Church of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The word <hi>Diſcipline</hi> alſo is uſed two wayes, as hath been ſaid; Firſt, In a larger ſenſe, as comprehending all order and behaviour concerning a Church in outward duties, and ſo (among the reſt) the daily planting and building by the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59346:102"/>and offering of the Word by the Miniſters, and the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, receiving, and obeying by the people. As military diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is put for the whole art or manner of ordering Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Secondly, In a more ſtrict ſignification it is the politicall guiding of the Church, and is exerciſed principally, if not onely in the

                           <hi>Henry Ainſw.</hi> firſt anſwer, &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 30. Whereupon Chriſt pronounced a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and annexed promiſes, not for himſelfe, but (as you grant for his ſucceſſours alſo, as I defend) for the other Apoſtles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. <hi>Ibid.</hi> Set you down by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, what is mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by <hi>keyes,</hi> and I will ſhew you by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures alſo, that the 12 Apoſtles had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall power in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them.</note> adminiſtration of Church cenſures; and this is that diſcipline which generally, all Eccleſiaſticall Writers ſpeake of. And this power likewiſe muſt be conſidered either in reſpect of right or the firſt act, as they call it, or in reſpect of execution and the ſecond act.</p>
                     <p>Theſe diſtinctions thus plainly propounded, the anſwer to the Propoſition is diſtinctly this; Firſt, If the word <hi>Diſcipline</hi> be taken in the largeſt acceptation, it is neceſſary to the Church, becauſe no Societie can be held or gathered without ſome order. Secondly, If it be taken in the ſtricteſt ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it belongeth not to the Communitie of the faithfull few or many. For the power of governing the Church belongeth to them primarily and in reſpect of uſe and execution, to

The Prieſt hath his Commiſſion as a ſervant to call for ſubjection and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, not unto himſelfe, but unto his Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter that ſent him, &amp;c. who muſt preach himſelf, the ſervant of meaner men than Princes, and make himſelfe the ſervant of all men, if he note wel the words of his Commiſſion, &amp;c.</note> whom Chriſt hath communicated it. But Chriſt hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this power to the faithfull, few or more, but to his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, whom he hath appointed to feed and governe his folke. Thirdly, If a ſocietie enjoy but one Paſtour or Teacher for the time, the power of government doth not belong unto him. For Chriſt hath not committed this power unto one but unto many. The power of

And if one alone may not challenge that which is committed unto a ſocietie, it is not for one Paſtour to excommunicate his people. And hence it followes neceſſarily, that diſcipline or power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning or diſpencing the keyes, is not abſolutely neceſſary to the being of the Church. For if there may be a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church without Paſtours or Teachers, but not

And if the Presbytery be the onely executioners of the cenſuring diſcipline, then if the Church may be without a Presbytery, it may want the diſcipline in reſpect of executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For where the Officer is wanting, there the office alſo is wanting as touching the execution thereof. If all the Officers of diſcipline ſhould dye at once, or the Church ſhould want her officers; the faithfull have not power of diſcipline either originally or actually, either to conveigh it virtually or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally to her Miniſters, whom ſhee might chuſe, or to execute it her ſelfe. But the faithfull doe remaine a Church, when her officers are

It is not to be doubted, that in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times every ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell was received, had many Prophets Paſtours and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, not only tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling to and fro, to exhort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the brethren, but abiding &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the ſame, all laboring to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the number of the Church, &amp;c.</note> diſperſed by perſecution, taken away by death, be wanting through her negligence, or ſome other way. In your own way and conſtitution, the Church may be without both Paſtour and Teacher, and that for a long time, till fit men may be choſen unto that office; in all which time it muſt want the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and execution of diſcipline.</p>
                     <p>We have not learned, that every Chriſtian is a King and a Prince, to rule with

The life and being of a Church ſtandeth in the very knitting of the faithfull unto Chriſt: for it is Chriſt that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſalvation to the body: And if union give it the forme of a Church, it muſt neceſſarily be a Church before it practice this diſcipline, becauſe it hath no place but in an united body or Congregation.

But this power of the keyes is not of abſolute neceſſitie to the being of the Church, but to the well-being onely.

                     <p>It would be knowne what you call maine truths, which concerne the outward regiment of Chriſts viſible Church. The power of government is proper and communicated: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that which Chriſt hath reſerved peculiar to himſelfe, and is executed according to his infinite wiſdome, by the ſecret hand of his divine power, and the effectuall worke of his holy Spirit, making the word of exhortation and reproofe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and inſtruction, to ſome the ſavour of life unto life; whence followeth effectuall anſwering to their calling, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, comfort, and growing up to perfection. Not to mention further, how he ſuccoureth the godly, beſtoweth ſome gifts, (though not ſuch as accompany Salvation) upon the wicked; bridleth, curbeth and confoundeth his enemies. His commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated Government is that which being limited within the compaſſe of certaine Lawes and Canons of his holy Word; he hath committed to be exerciſed and executed in and by So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, according to his appointment. The chiefe and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall meanes Chriſt uſeth here, is the preaching of his Word, whereby he ſaveth his people, and conquereth his enemies. The diſcipline is as a Chariot for the Word to ride upon, and to keepe other ordinances from contempt; but it is not the moſt ordinary or mighty meanes of Chriſts government or adminiſtration of his Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things being thus, The Miniſters of the Goſpell are to teach the people the maine grounds and chiefe heads of Chriſtian Religion, even all things neceſſary to ſalvation in reſpect of faith and manners, otherwiſe they ſtand guilty of the bloud of ſoules. They are to teach them alſo what the Lord hath inſtituted for the well-ordering of his houſe, but in ſeaſon, order, and as they are able to beare it. It is not for men to ſet up the roofe, before they have laid the foundation.

Alſo godly men, who follow the truth in love, may be of different minds in theſe things, and for men to hide that from the people, whereof they are not perſwaded that it is the truth of God, is not the note of a falſe Prophet.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Thoſe things which you call maine truths, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the externall government of Chriſts viſible Church, may juſtly be queſtioned, whether they be truths at all. If I may conjecture by your writings, the maine truths you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend are ſuch as theſe; That power of Church-government is abſolutely neceſſary to the being of a Church; That all ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or ſet-formes of prayer or Liturgie, are forged or deviſed worſhip; That there is no lawfull Miniſter, who is not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, called, or ordained by that particular Congregation, where he is to adminiſter; That the Miniſter of one congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation may performe no miniſteriall act in another; That the power of Government is in the communitie of the faithfull, and from them derived unto the Paſtours, Teachers, or Elders, &amp;c. Theſe and the like are the maine truths in your eſteeme, which I conceive have no bottoming in the holy Scripture. And if the Nonconformiſts, or ſome other, ſhould aske of you this Queſtion, whether to teach ſuch points as maine truths neceſſary to ſalvation, and to condemne all Churches who conforme not to your platforme, as falſe and Antichriſtian, and their worſhip as falſe and idolatrous; and whether to wreſt and abuſe Scriptures, and pervert Authors to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, make you not a falſe Prophet, conſider adviſedly what ound and ſatisfying anſwer you could returne.</p>

For it is their direct aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion to the contrary, that for want of orderly adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diſcipline, Chriſtians are not to ſeparate from the true and ſound Churches of Jeſus Chriſt. Your phraſe likewiſe of placing themſelves about the throne of God, is in no ſort ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of them, or of the truth it ſelfe: As if none were placed about the throne of God, or God did not graciouſly vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe his preſence unto, or reigne over any aſſembly, wherein diſcipline is not rightly and orderly in all points admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred.</p>
                     <p>But here it muſt be noted, that the power of government muſt be conſidered, either in reſpect of the ſubſtance of it, or the orderly manner of adminiſtration, as was ſaid before. And a thing or office is called Antichriſtian in two reſpects. Firſt, as whatſoever is not of Chriſt is Antichriſtian; in which ſenſe, they of the Separation call all ſtinted Liturgies Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59346:108"/>Secondly, as that which is derived from the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and headſhip of the great Antichriſt of Rome, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth upon him as his owne inſtitution, is Antichriſtian. And to apply theſe things to the purpoſe; if we take the word <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> in the firſt ſignification, the true Church of God may be under Antichriſtian government, in reſpect of the manner of diſpenſation of the cenſures, that is, the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the cenſures may be committed to ſuch perſons as are not inſtituted, approved, and ſet apart of Chriſt for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and in ſuch manner. As if it be committed to an uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped power over the Brethren, or to ſome few of many, or to ſuch as be ignorant, prophant, or the like.</p>
                     <p>It is true, the light hath no fellowſhip with darkneſſe, nor truth with falſhood: but in this life light in men is miked with darkneſſe, and the beſt Chriſtians infected with errours of Antichriſtianiſme. In many of the Martyrs of Jeſus Chriſt, both before &amp; ſince the revelation of Antichriſt, their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was mingled with more darkneſſe, and their Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie with more antichriſtianiſme, if you will ſo call it, than can be found in our Church and Miniſtery.

For the politicall guiding of a Church by the cenſuring diſcipline, is not to be compared to the want &amp; neglect of the Seales. If the Church ſhall thinke good to keepe in a member, which ſome private man judgeth worthy to be excommunicated, muſt he cut off himſelfe, or caſt out the offender contrary to the order. If the Power of government be exerciſed by the whole body of the Societie, which I conceive to belong onely to the Colledge Eccleſiaſticall, muſt I needs ſeparate from them as no Church of Chriſt?</p>

If you could not diſcerne this in their writings, you were very blinde and partiall. If you did diſcerne it and yet would paſſe it over, that you might with ſome colour tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them as going contrary to their owne principles, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile others with an aequivocation, where was your ſincerity? The Nonconformiſts will not deny, but ſome things in the gathering and planting, or rather the refining and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was and is done amiſſe, not agreeable to the Word of God, which they heartily deſire and labour might be reformed; but for things done amiſſe, they dare not condemne the Church, deny the grace of God, ſeparate from her communion, or approve them that doe it.

If this be your cloſe intendment, the propoſition is farre from truth, the minde of the Nonconformiſts, and the matter in hand: for in the reformation a new Church was not planted, but a corrupt Church refined or purified. And thus I might paſſe over that which followeth in your next Section, becauſe every man may eaſily perceive it reacheth not to the point in hand, but that you ſhould not complaine as if your reaſons were neglected, I will follow you therein.</p>

But they will ſay, This is at leaſt to communicate in their ſinne, nay, this confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is moſt falſe. For if I come prepared to the Supper, I am not to ſearch with what conſcience any man doth come to it with me, but I muſt take care of mine owne conſcience. Therefore if I come to the Supper, chaſte and free from wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, though I communicate with adulterers, with mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, and with moſt wicked wretches, ſo they be ſuch by no fault of mine, their impuritie ſhall not hurt me. And what I ſpeake of manners, I alſo ſay of doctrine, which ſometimes the Paſtours doe not purely deliver, nor the hearers receive well and holily. I will ſay more, if ſome Paſtour either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly or adviſedly, ſhould admit a Jew or Turke, the whole fault of that fact ſhall fall upon him, and I would not come no more ſlackly to the Table of the Lord; becauſe his impure conſcience, ſo I be without fault, doth not pollute mine which is pure; and that very Supper is pure to me, which that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure perſon prophaneth. Thus <hi>Beza.</hi> And this may be ſhewed to be the conſtant judgement of all orthodox Divines, not parties in this caſe, and it is a thing ſo well knowne, that it is ſuperfluous labour to examine the reſt particularly. And here let it be noted, That it is uſuall to define the Church by the better part, by the true and living, chiefe principall and perpetuall members, partakers of the royalties and liberties of the catholike Church, knit unto Chriſt, quickned by the Spirit, heires of ſalvation, &amp; one with the triumphant church:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59346:123"/>And not by all ſorts, as in outward ſocietie and profeſſion are linked together, who yet are not excluded from the ſocietie in reſpect of profeſſion, nor denied to be members of the Church in their kinde or in a ſort ſuch as are called onely by externall vocation, are members in their kinde of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany called, or externally ſelected, but not true members of the Church militant, nor militant members of the Church catholique, whereof Chriſt is the head. And thus the church is a company of faithfull people, ſincere, upright, walking with God, which is mixed with hypocrites and wicked li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, not as living members of Jeſus Chriſt, but as members in a ſort of the viſible ſocietie; as members in the church by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion, but not of the true militant church.</p>

The true viſible Church of Chriſt is a ſocietie of beleeving and faithfull people, and a communion of Saints, ſo ſay the Conformiſts. But the Church of England is not a ſocietie of beleeving and faithfull people, a communion of Saints (thus write the Nonconformiſts, ſee page</hi> 169.) Ergo, <hi>the Church of England is not the true viſible Church. The true Church is the Kings daughter, deſcribed in Pſalme</hi> 45. <hi>But the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is not the Kings daughter ſo deſcribed.

But they never thought nor taught, that every member in a ſort, of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Churches, were holy and ſincere, the true ſheepe of Chriſt faithfull, and effectually called: much leſſe, that it was no Church of Chriſt, wherein abuſes were to be found, or ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prophane men were tolerated.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59346:124"/>Kingdome. The Church viſible and inviſible are not two Churches, but diſtinct conſiderations of the ſame Church. If then we ſpeake of true, ſound, living, chiefe, principle members of the militant Church, ſuch as partake in all the royalties and priviledges of members, every member of the Church militant is a true branch in the Vine, knit firmely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, quickned by the Spirit, and ſhall be an inheriter of eternall glory. But if we ſpeake of members in a ſort of viſible ſocieties, ſo hypocrites may be members, and ungodly men, as they are tolerated in the ſocietie, when the better part can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reforme or amend them.</p>
                     <p>But to the Arguments in order.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Church may be true though the Miniſtery be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in the order of calling, qualification of perſons, and execution of their office: But that Church is falſe whoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery is altogether falſe for ſubſtance of their office, that is the doctrine which they teach, Sacraments which they admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and functions whereunto they are ſet apart. Thus the Conformiſts and Inconformiſts both. Now if we ſpeake of the Miniſtery of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> indefinitly, both Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts and Inconformiſts will confeſſe ſome things to be faulty both in the entrance and execution of their callings; as that ſome are ignorant, proud, covetous, careleſſe, corrupt, not watching over the flocke: But abſolutely that their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery is falſe in reſpect of the ſubſtance of their office, that was never ſaid by either of them, as you doe or might well know. The knot to be unlooſed now remaineth in your conſcience, in that either you aequivocate in your Major, or againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, charge the Nonconformiſts in your Minor, with that which they never ſaid.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The true Church of Chriſt, that is, the true and lively members of the militant church, and militant members of the catholique church, is a company of

Thus the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts and Inconformiſts. And in this ſenſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a ſocietie of faithfull and beleeving people, the flocke of Chriſt, the Kings daughter, quickned by the Spirit, enriched with grace, decked with Gods ordinances, walking in ſincere conſtant conſcionable obedience, though in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſocietie and profeſſion, mixed with many ignorant, vaine prophane perſons, who have received the preſſe-money of Chriſt, but indeed fight under the Devils banner, as doe all hypocrites and ungodly wretches; that is, in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> there be ſome truely of the Church which heare the voyce of Chriſt, mixed with thoſe which in words profeſſe Chriſt, but in their deeds deny him: Thus the Conformiſts and Nonconformiſts. The knot here lyeth onely in an aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation or groſſe abuſe of the word <hi>Church,</hi> which ſometimes notes the whole viſible ſocietie, linked in an externall profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſometimes the true and living members of Jeſus Chriſt, againſt which the gates of hell ſhall not prevaile.</p>

The Church is not ſimply a number of men; for Infidels, heretickes, and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, are not the Church, but men regenerate by the Word &amp; Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, truely ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of his Sonne, and ſealed by the Spirit of grace, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the day of Redemption.</note> all that are linked with them in outward ſocietie, doe not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely obey, not yet in converſation faſhion themſelves to the direction and commandement of Jeſus Chriſt. And thus the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that is, the true and faithfull people in thoſe ſocieties, doe heare and obey the voyce of Chriſt in truth, others mixed with them doe heare and profeſſe but not obey. If the Church doe erre, it is of ignorance, nor of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, or ſtubbornneſſe: In matters of leſſe importance, not fundamentall or bordering thereupon: It is the errour of ſome onely, add not of the whole Church, which errours

                     <p>Fourthly, In the true Church of Chriſt, the true doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, the Prophets and Apoſtles in matters funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall is kept, but ſo as the living members may erre both in doctrine and manners, and others in ſocietie with them may erre groſſely, impenitently, finally. And thus the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth keepe the doctrine of

                     <p>Fifthly, No ſocietie is the Church of Chriſt, which retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not the true worſhip of God, but in the true Church of God, his pure worſhip may be ſtained with rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which might well be ſpared, and are juſtly diſliked. Thus both Conformiſts and Nonconformiſts, and all other ſorts and ſects of men. And thus in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the true worſhip of God is for ſubſtance rightly maintained, though the Nonconformiſts diſlike, and the Conformiſts groane under ſome ceremonies not abandoned, The onely knot here to be unlooſed againe is your ſlander againſt the Nonconformiſts, in that you charge them to ſay, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not retaine the true worſhip of God.</p>
                     <p>And now I ſhall deſire you calmely to conſider how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your principles you can untie a knot or two, if they ſhould be knit for you in this wiſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He is no true Paſtor of Jeſus Chriſt, who groſſely perverteth the Scripture, falſifieth Authors, deceiveth with aequivocations, condemneth the true worſhip of God as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious idolatrie, and the

                     <p>Secondly, He is no true Miniſter who derives his authoritie from them that are not able to give it. But he that derives his authoritie from the people, derives it from them that have no authoritie to give it. You know the concluſion, and where it will light.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The true Church of God is the true flock of Chriſt, the Kings Daughter, quickened by the Spirit, married unto Chriſt, gentle, meeke, humble, retaining the true worſhip of God, without addition or alteration, and keeping the unitie of the Spirit in the bond of peace; But the ſocietie of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts is not the true flocke of Chriſt, quickned by the Spirit, humble, meeke, gentle, keeping the unitie of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Theſe properties doe not agree to all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in that ſocietie in truth, according as in the former propoſitions, you ſay, they belong to the true Church of God. If you ſhall be able to maintaine the former propoſitions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt men, as you vaunt, I doe not beleeve you ſhall be able to unlooſe theſe few knots.</p>

                     <p>THis point concerning Lecturers, I have purpoſely defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto this place, becauſe it is diſtinct from the former in your apprehenſion, and in this you doe not pretend the Nonconformiſts principles, as you did in the former. The exceptions alſo which you take againſt them, are not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of gifts, learning, or diligence, nor that they are brought
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59346:127"/>into the Church by Antichriſt, but chiefly in reſpect of the office and Miniſtery it ſelfe. That which you object concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the name, that it is new (as you doe before againſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Vicars, and Curates, that they are Popiſh) is too ſlight to be inſiſted upon. For theſe and divers other names or titles given to the Preachers of the Word, doe not note different Miniſteries for ſubſtance and kinde, but different accidents whereby the Miniſters are diſtinguiſhed, and ſometimes the employment whereabout they are principally exerciſed. But the Miniſtery which is exerciſed under thoſe names, is for ſubſtance one and the ſame, which Chriſt hath appointed and ſet his Church. If any man hath not been able to anſwer this Queſtion when it hath been propounded, what kinde of Miniſtery the Lecturers have taken up, it was from his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, not from the difficultie of the matter. And this is no marvaile, ſeeing many Queſtions ſeeme Riddles to you, which very eaſily untie themſelves, or be knit in conceit one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. As to the Papiſts many Queſtions touching the certaintie of our Religion, the calling of our Miniſters, the continuance of the faith, ſeeming indiſſoluble, which a true hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian can quickly diſſolve. But <hi>you write upon certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that ſome have ingenuouſly confeſſed, that unleſſe they be Evangeliſts, they could not ſee how their Miniſtery doth accord with any Miniſtery mentioned in the New Teſtament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I am not ſo diffident as to diſtruſt every word that is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, nor muſt I be ſo ſimple as to beleeve every thing. In the quoting of mens words in writing, and giving the ſenſe of them, I finde you trip ſo often ignorantly or upon ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and ſo many times to quote that as making for you, which is as direct againſt you as can be ſpoken, that without breach of charitie, I may ſuſpect ſome ſuch thing in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; either that you miſtooke their meaning, or miſrelate their words, or ſet downe your owne conſequence for their poſition, or the like. Inſtances of your miſtaking enough hath beene formerly mentioned, in this very place there be two of no ſmall note, nor hard to be diſproved. Firſt you ſay, <hi>The Nonconformists condemne the calling of Parſons and Vicars</hi> (their office you meane) <hi>as falſe and Antichriſtian.</hi> But their practice and profeſſion both, doth evidence the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the whole world, as hath beene ſhewed. And if you will miſtake their writings ſo palpably and againe and againe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59346:127"/>affirme them from their writings, what is not there to be found, but is direct contrary to their judgement, writing and practice, how can we beleeve that you truely report their words. Secondly, you ſay; <hi>The Reformiſts doe utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne this extraordinary office of Preachers.</hi> Lecturers you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by extraordinary Preachers; but extraordinary they are not, either in reſpect of their calling, or the worke wherein they are imployed. And the Nonconformiſts are ſo farre from condemning that office, that it is well knowne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, if not the greateſt part of them, had none other calling, or office in the Church. And I preſume every reaſonable man, will conceive it an unlikely thing, that ſo many godly and learned men, ſuffering many and great troubles againſt other abuſes, ſhould chooſe to live in ſuch a calling, againſt the light of their conſcience.

                     <p>It is not then the common judgement of the Reformiſts, nor the private opinion of any particular man of that minde, that I have ſeene or heard of, that the office or calling of a Lecturer is utterly to be condemned. Who the Author is, or what the worke which you quote, entituled, <hi>The Neceſſitie of Diſcipline,</hi> I know not, nor what he ſaith.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps you alledge him, as you have done others wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; It may be he ſpeakes of ſome circumſtances, not of the ſubſtance of the calling. If he goe any further, it is his private conceit, and muſt not be imputed to the Reformiſts, as you ſtile them.</p>
                     <p>We neede not here diſpute of the difference, betwixt the Paſtour and the Teacher, nor to enquire whether of theſe they are to be eſteemed, untill the difference betwixt them be exactly defined, and ſubſtantially proved: If for ſubſtance of Miniſtery they doe the worke of the Lord Jeſus, and by his approbation, this ſufficeth.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then here it is to be noted, that the Officers of the Church are not ſo diſtinguiſhed by heir ſpeciall limits and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59346:128"/>bounds, but the ſuperiour may doe the office of the reſt, if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie require.

                     <p>Secondly, If the Paſtour be aged, weake, ſickly, unable to beare the burden of his charge alone, he may take unto him, with conſent of the ſocietie and colledge Eccleſiaſticall, Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or Helpers;

Thus alſo the Ancients write, that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> were the firſt Biſhops and Apoſtles at Rome. <hi>Paul</hi> had <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Timothy; Peter, Clemens</hi> and <hi>Anacletus.

It is apparent, the Apoſtles ordained many Overſeers in one ſocietie, and it is not repugnant either to Scripture or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to thinke there might be many Paſtours of one flocke;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59346:128"/>And the flocke might be one under the joynt care of many Shepheards,

Every church with them had many Prophets, Paſtours and Teachers, the number and neede of the people, and time ſo requiring. <hi>T.

For to aſſemble together in one place, is meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accidentall to the unitie of a ſocietie: Certaine it is, in times of perſecution they cannot ſo meete; and it is moſt probable, in the Apoſtles times, many Churches were too populous in that manner to aſſemble together. Thoſe that know the ſtate of France in time of perſecution, doe well underſtand that every Church almoſt was gathered of Townes, whereof ſome were ſix miles, ſome ſeven, ſome more from the place of mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and keeping their Congregations. And therefore could not meete ſo often, nor know one another ſo well, as we by the grace of God may doe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, No one Paſtour or Teacher hath the power of the cenſures belonging unto him, and whether the power of diſpenſing the Seales belong to every Miniſter of the Goſpell, I leave it to your conſideration, (for I know not what you will reſolve) but the actuall diſpenſation of the Seales may be forborne by ſome, to whom the right of diſpencing doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine, ſpecially when there be others at hand to doe that office. The Apoſtles had power to baptize,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.14, 15, 16. <hi>Can. Neceſ. of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat. pag.</hi> 236.</note> but we may well thinke, they did not ordinarily baptize themſelves. It is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible (you ſay) a man may be a true Eccleſiaſticall Officer, and yet never doe the ſervices thereof.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The Miniſter of the Goſpell is not made abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely a Miniſter by the choice or election of this or that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but onely their Miniſter for the time of his abode and continuance with them. Lay theſe things together, and then your exceptions againſt the office of Lecturers will vaniſh. For if they have not the chiefe charge or cure of ſoules, they be not ſole Paſtours or Teachers of the flocke; but joyned in care or charge with others as Helpers or Aſſiſtants, or choſen by the people to ſupply the want of ſuch as ſhould, but doe not feed the flocke. If they diſpence not the Seales, neither is that neceſſary in reſpect of their ſtanding: for right and power from Chriſt they have to diſpence them, but in the execution of that power they may be hindred, or forbeare it for a time. If they leave their place being lawfully called to another flocke, it may be with conſent of the ſocietie and of the Church, and what then doth make it unlawfull? or if the charge ſhould be unlawfull, it doth not make the Miniſtery ſtrange or new, which is the thing in queſtion.</p>

                     <hi>is unlawfull and falſe. But the Miniſtery of Lecturers in England is instituted and ſet beſide theſe, which God hath appointed in his Word. Therefore that Miniſtery is unlawfull and falſe. The propoſition is plaine and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable, and we have their owne words to confirme it. For thus they ſay, All the Ministery is by the Word of God, and not left to the will of man to deviſe at their pleaſure, as appeareth by that which is noted of</hi> John, <hi>where the Phariſees comming to him, after that he had denied to be either Chriſt, or Elias, or another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, conclude if he be neither Chriſt nor Elias, nor of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, why baptizeſt thou?

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Aſſumption is thus proved. Firſt if their Lecturers have taken ordination from the Biſhops, and exerciſe by that power one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then is their office falſe, by the reaſons before laid downe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, If it be objected, that they never received the Prelates or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or have repented thereof, I anſwer, This proves not that they are therefore true Ministers. For as</hi> Jehu, <hi>though he did well to ſuppreſſe</hi> Ahabs <hi>idolatrie, yet in that he followed the wayes of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam, <hi>he himſelfe continued ſtill a groſſe Idolater: Even ſo; howſoever ſome may privately report, that they ſtand Miniſters by no relation to the Biſhops, yet are they notwithſtanding unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministers, ſeeing they were never elected, choſen, ordained according to Gods Word. If any reply, that they have their calling of the people: I anſwer, the thing is ſurely otherwiſe, as ſhall be manifeſted preſently. But if this were granted, yet I deny that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Church under heaven, hath power from Chriſt to ordaine ſuch a kinde of Miniſtery, and therefore if any people ſhould doe it, ſeeing it is againſt the Scripture, it muſt needs follow, that it is an unlawfull Miniſtery, and ſo conſequently not to be communicated with.</hi>

                     <p>YOu are ſtrangely taken with this note; for you have brought nothing but a bare repetition, of what you have
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59346:129"/>ſaid over and over. If you ſpeake of the ſubſtantiall and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall parts of the Miniſtery, it is freely granted, that the true Miniſtery is by the word of God, and heavenly. But if you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it to every circumſtantiall order, whereby in this or that Societie, the Miniſter is to execute the function he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of God, it is not approved. But of this you need not to have made ſo many words. To your aſſumption, anſwer hath been returned already.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That the Miniſters of the Goſpell receive their office and authoritie, neither from the Biſhop, Patron, people, or Colledge Eccleſiaſticall, but from Chriſt immediately, whoſe ſervants they are, in whoſe name they miniſter, whoſe flocke they attend, and who hath aſſigned them their worke. And if you receive your Miniſtery from the people, as their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, from whom you derive your office and authoritie, and from whom you receive your Commiſſion; your Miniſtery in that reſpect is no leſſe falſe and antichriſtian, than theirs that derive it from the Biſhops.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If Lecturers have received ordination from the Biſhops, and be called and choſen by the people, their calling is juſt and lawfull, according to the rules of Scripture, and their Miniſtery heavenly and from above, if they preach the intire faith, and feed the flocke of God. For they preach the pure doctrine of ſalvation, not by authoritie from men, but by commiſſion from the chiefe Shepheard and Biſhop of our ſoules: their calling may be juſtified by the Word and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of truth, which ſhall ſtand for ever; the more hainous and fearefull is your ſinne, in matching the Miniſtery of ſuch men, to the idolatry of <hi>Jehu.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, You are bold to affirme, That no Church under Heaven, hath power from Chriſt to ordaine ſuch a kinde of Miniſtery, &amp;c. And it is true, the Church hath no power to ordaine any Miniſtery; for Chriſt is the Author and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the Miniſtery for his Church. But your meaning is, That this kinde of Miniſtery is againſt the Scripture not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, and then if we call for your proofe, we have nothing here, but I deny it.

If any object, that they preach the Word. To this</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ames <hi>gives an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer fully, that the preaching of the Goſpell is not a worke peculiar to a Miniſter: for ſuch as are private men, and out of office, may and ought to preach the Word, as occaſion is offered, and not onely privately, but, ſaith he, in the publique Congregation, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>VVE have here the ſame thing over againe, and when all is ſaid, it is but this, I deny it, or I ſay it. The aſſumption cannot for ſhame be denied. The propoſition rightly underſtood is true and ſound, but it may carry divers conſtructions. As firſt, the meaning may be, That Miniſtery is for ſubſtance unlawfull, which none may lawfully give to ſuch or ſuch perſons, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to ſuch as be unfit or prophane. And in this ſenſe, the propoſition is not ſound. For the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery is unlawfully committed to an ungodly man, an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, but the Miniſtery it ſelfe is heavenly, and from above. Or the ſenſe may be, That Miniſtery is unlawfull which men may not lawfully give virtually or formally: And then it is weake; For Paſtours and Teachers are the gifts of Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Church, from whom they receive their office, and not
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59346:130"/>from men, Or it may beare this ſenſe. That Miniſtery is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, which none may lawfully give in ſuch forme, and manner, as it is executed? And then it is lyable to exception. For of right the power of adminiſtration of the Seales and Cenſures of the Church, belong to the Paſtours, Teachers, and Governours of the Church; when in the execution of this office, they may be hindred. It is lawfull to be an aſſiſtant or helper to a Paſtour for a time, when it is not lawfull to give the office of Miniſtery to a man for a time onely, and then to expire. To the aſſumption; The Lecturers of whom we ſpeak, have derived their office from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by the Miniſtery of his Church, as inſtruments, their entrance into it lawfull, the ſervice and worke it ſelfe holy, the manner of performing it warrantable, and the authoritie they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſame which Chriſt hath communicated to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpell. To publiſh the truth by way of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or exhortation, is not peculiar to the Miniſters of the Goſpell, but by authoritie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

<note place="margin">Math. 28.19. 1 Cor. 1.</note> who have received commiſſion from Jeſus Chriſt. And if private perſons may preach the Word in this ſenſe, we ſee no reaſon why they may not adminiſter the Sacraments likewiſe, and ſo the Governours of the Church ſhall have power to doe nothing, which every private mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſocietie may not doe as well as they. But Lecturers preach the Goſpell by authoritie, and as men ſet in office by the Lord of the harveſt.
